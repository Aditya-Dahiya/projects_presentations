::: panel-tabset
### I

iii. All notes should be written in the third person.

### II

iv. Relevant extracts of the provisions of the Act, Rules, and /or guidelines will be placed on the file, and attention will be drawn to it in the note, rather than reproducing the relevant provisions in the note.
v.  Make a note of the actual points proposed to make without reiterating the ground already covered in the previous notes. If one agrees with the line of action suggested in the preceding note, merely append a signature.
vi. A self-contained note will be put up with every case submitted to the Administrative Secretary or Minister.

### III

vii. A self-contained note is prepared while seeking advice or opinion or concurrence of another Department.

:::

## U.O. Letter or Un-Official References - I {.smaller}

1.  Inter-departmental references are made un-officially to officers and Heads of Departments who are not part of Secretariat.
2.  When Secretaries to Government desire to obtain an expression of opinion, advice, or supplementary information from such officers and Heads of Departments in an un-official manner, they should do so by sending the files and notes.
3.  It is only where these officers make references as Secretaries on their own files that it is treated as an un-official reference.

## U.O. Letter or Un-Official References - II {.smaller}

4.  In the case of inter-departmental reference, the department or office of origin should state, with as much precision as possible, the specific points in respect to which reference is made.
5.  References to the Legal Remembrancer should definitely state the points on which his opinion or advice is required.

## U.O. Letter or Un-Official References - III {.smaller}

6.  In every file referred to by one department or office to another department or office, the notes written in the department or office referred to should (when this is desirable) be on separate sheets (in duplicate) from the notes written in the referring department, and the conclusion only should be recorded under the signature of the officer to whom an un-official reference was made.

## Level of Approval of Draft

-   After the orders are passed by the competent authority on a file, the Draft for Approval (DFA) should be approved by the authority minimum one step above the authority who has to sign the fair draft, except in routine cases (e.g., reminder letter, supply of definite information) after the approval of the competent authority.

## Drafting by Officers of Important Cases

-   Branch officers are expected to prepare drafts of important cases. As a general rule, the Branch officer should send to Branch only such cases for submission of drafts, which can easily be followed by an Assistant/Dealing hand.

## Inter-Departmental Consultation

-   On file, the consultation with the concerned Department can be done by either of the two methods:
    -   By referring the case file; or
    -   By making a self-contained U.O. (Un-Official) reference with all relevant documents.
-   The first method is the common one and is generally followed in most of the cases, as it is simple because all relevant papers are usually available in the case file.

## Dealing Files from Another Department

-   In every file referred by one Department to another for advice, concurrence, or opinion, the notes written by the Department or Branch/Section referred to should be on a 'shadow file,' i.e., a separate file.
-   In case the proposal of the receiving Department has been approved by the concerned Minister-in-Charge/Chief Minister, then a specific mention should be made in the advice being tendered to the referring Department that "Minister-in-Charge or Chief Minister, as the case may be, has approved."

# File Presentation

## Examination of File Note by a Branch In-charge

-   When making suggestions for approval of senior officers, the Branch In-charge will confine his note to the actual points he proposes to make without re-iterating the grounds already covered in the previous notes.
-   State the questions for consideration and bring out clearly the points requiring a decision.

## Running Summary of Facts

-   To facilitate consideration and to obviate repeated recapitulation in important, complex, and court cases, a running summary of facts will be prepared and placed on the file in a separate folder labeled as such in every case where it is evident that such a summary would contribute to its speedy disposal.
-   Previous versions of the running summary, if any, shall not be destroyed.

## Modification of Notes or Order

-   Where a final decision already communicated to a party is found later on to have been given on a mistaken ground or wrong facts or wrong interpretation of rules due to misunderstanding or otherwise, such replacement or modification of a note may have legal implications.
-   In all such cases, wherever necessary, a review of the decision should be examined, and the revised decision shall be taken with the approval of an officer higher than the one, if available, who took the original decision.

# **A.I.** in our Workplace

## Why? {.larger}

## 1. **The Fall of the Byzantine Empire:**

-   The Byzantine Empire fell in 1453 to the Ottoman Empire in part because they failed to adopt newer military technologies such as gunpowder cannons and firearms. This historic event illustrates how the reluctance to embrace technological innovation can lead to a civilization's downfall.

## 2. **The Kodak Story**:

-   Kodak, once a dominant force in the photography industry, failed to embrace digital photography technology in its early stages. The company's reluctance to adapt eventually led to its decline, while digital photography companies like Canon and Nikon thrived. This story emphasizes the importance of staying ahead in the technology curve.

## 3. **Nokia and the Smartphone Revolution**:

-   Nokia, once the world's largest mobile phone manufacturer, underestimated the shift toward smartphones and touchscreen technology. Their inability to adapt quickly led to a significant decline in market share and eventual acquisition by Microsoft. It underscores the importance of recognizing and adapting to industry-changing technologies.
