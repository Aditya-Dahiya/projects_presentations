Hello! I’m [Aditya Dahiya](https://aditya-dahiya.github.io/), a health financing and data visualization enthusiast with a penchant for making sense of the world's messy data. I’ve been lucky enough to study MBBS and [live](https://www.scribd.com/document/52499148/Hybrid-Hues-Final) at [AIIMS, New Delhi](https://www.aiims.edu/index.php/en), and earn a Master of Public Health from [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) — [experiences](https://gsas.harvard.edu/housing/life-residence-halls/residence-hall-overview/conant-hall) that taught me the importance of both precision and perspective. Along the way, I’ve also been honored with a [Fulbright](https://fulbrightindiaguide.org.in/the-fulbright-commission-in-india/) [Fellowship](https://www.usief.org.in/Fellowships/Fulbright-Nehru-Master-Fellowships.aspx), which, while impressive on paper, mostly taught me how much there still is to learn!

When I’m not wading through the endless sea of paperwork at my job in [Haryana](https://haryana.gov.in/)'s [bureaucracy](http://web1.hry.nic.in/civillist/iias.aspx), you can find me diving into my true passion: turning complex data into [captivating visual tales](https://aditya-dahiya.github.io/projects_presentations/data_vizs.html). With [`R`](https://cran.r-project.org/) as my trusty sidekick—especially [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)—I strive to make the complicated a tad less daunting and a lot more delightful!

So feel free to browse through my [presentations](https://aditya-dahiya.github.io/projects_presentations/presentations.html), [reports](https://aditya-dahiya.github.io/projects_presentations/projects.html), [charts](https://aditya-dahiya.github.io/projects_presentations/data_vizs.html), or, other [works](https://aditya-dahiya.github.io/). I hope you’ll find some clarity and maybe even a bit of fun in the visuals I’ve created. After all, who says data can’t be interesting?
