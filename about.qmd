**Dr. Aditya Dahiya, IAS**

Welcome to [my corner](https://aditya-dahiya.github.io/ "Personal Website: Aditya Dahiya") of the internet, where I aim to share my experiences and insights gained from a journey that has taken me from the halls of Harvard to the heart of Haryana. I am Dr. Aditya Dahiya, an IAS officer with a background in medicine, and it's truly an honor to have you here. This website serves as a platform where I house the session presentations from various lectures I've had the privilege of giving in different places. As I embark on this digital voyage, my hope is to engage with you in meaningful conversations about the worlds of public health, governance, and perhaps even a few stories from the tennis court.

**Connect with me!**

Well, folks, that's my life in a nutshell - a whirlwind journey that's taken me from Harvard's hallowed halls to the heartland of Haryana, from the world of scalpels and stethoscopes to the battlefield of bureaucracy, and yes, from the operating room to the tennis court *(where I sometimes try to 'serve' justice, pun intended)*.

Don't hesitate to connect, dear reader. I'm just a click away, and I'd love to hear your thoughts, questions, or maybe even your own adventures from the world of academia, administration, or sports. ðŸŽ“ðŸŽ¾
