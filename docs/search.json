I am Dr. Aditya Dahiya, an IAS officer with a background in medicine, and it’s truly an honor to have you here. This website serves as a platform where I house the session presentations from various lectures I’ve had the privilege of giving in different places. As I embark on this digital voyage, my hope is to engage with you in meaningful conversations about the worlds of public health, governance, and perhaps even a few stories from the tennis court."
