I am Dr. Aditya Dahiya, an IAS officer with a background in medicine, and it’s truly an honor to have you here. This website serves as a platform where I house the session presentations from various lectures I’ve had the privilege of giving in different places. As I embark on this digital voyage, my hope is to engage with you in meaningful conversations about the worlds of public health, governance, and perhaps even a few stories from the tennis court."

We won’t stop at just displaying the numbers. We’ll also throw in some flair by illustrating the average delays associated with each of these carriers, injecting a dose of character into the aviation landscape of the Big Apple. We’re going to unravel the secrets of creating animated racing bar charts using the formidable ggplot2 and gganimate packages in R.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)          # Loading Tidyverse for data wrangling\nlibrary(gt)                 # Loading gt package for beautiful tables\nlibrary(gganimate)          # For animations\nlibrary(nycflights13)       # for the flights data-set\nlibrary(lubridate)          # to handle dates in tidyverse\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Loading the flights dataset\ndata(\"flights\")\n\n# Pick out the top nine airline carriers only, to avoid crowding the\n# upcoming animated plot\ncarriers_to_plot &lt;- flights |&gt;\n  \n  # Count the number of flights for each carrier and sort them in descending order\n  count(carrier, sort = TRUE) |&gt;\n  \n  # Select the top 9 carriers based on flight count\n  slice_head(n = 9) |&gt;\n  \n  # Extract the 'carrier' column from the result\n  pull(carrier)\n\ndf &lt;- flights |&gt; \n  \n  # Filter the flights dataset to include only the top 9 carriers\n  filter(carrier %in% carriers_to_plot) |&gt; \n  \n  # Create a new 'date' column by combining year, month, and day\n  # This allows us to make a single date variable, that nicely evolves\n  # over time in an animated plot\n  mutate(date = make_date(year = year, month = month, day = day)) |&gt; \n  \n  # Select only the 'date' and 'carrier' columns\n  select(date, carrier) |&gt;\n  \n  # Joining the full names of airlines for the annotations in animated plot\n  left_join(nycflights13::airlines, by = join_by(carrier)) |&gt;\n  \n  # Remove the 'carrier' column after joining\n  select(-carrier) |&gt;\n  \n  # Rename the 'name' column to 'carrier'\n  rename(carrier = name) |&gt;\n  \n  # Count the number of flights for each date and carrier combination\n  count(date, carrier)\n\n\n\n\nExample 1\nThe visualization below captures the total number of flights operated by each carrier each month, spanning the entire year from January to December 2013.
