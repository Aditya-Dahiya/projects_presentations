Some are able to put the powder into their mouths and blow it out their noses. Thus, they imitate a smoker’s exhale.

"The sugar in Smarties can irritate the nose acutely and over the long term. In addition to the local irritation from the foreign material and powder, over time, the Smarties can lead to various overgrowth of bugs including viruses/fungi/bacteria. The quote regarding the maggots relates to the fact that when a foreign material, and especially a food, resides in the nose for a long period of time, infections may occur, worms may reside in the nose, even maggots may flourish in this environment — and we have encountered such a problem in the past.

"It is simply not possible for cell phones to transmit at frequencies that would cause immediate fatalities. This legend depends on a misunderstanding of how frequency waves and resonance work. Sound waves and vibrations can be destructive (consider sound waves breaking glass or the destruction of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge), but circumstances have to be very precise for this to happen. (The University of Salford explains how to replicate the glass shattering effect with sound waves). One key element is volume: without enough volume, sound waves simply do not vibrate glass hard enough to cause destruction. Since cell phones have a limited volume range, this affects their ability to cause damage to the brain.

Their sentences were later commuted to life in prison when the death penalty was abolished in 1972.

The Family were also said to be in possession of three Super-8 cameras and to have used them to make homegrown porn films.

"In 1976 the movie Snuff caused a tremendous stir when the word hit the street that an actual film depicting the on-screen murder of an actress had been smuggled into the States from South America, and this was it. Widely-believed hype aside, the film's origin was much more mundane. Snuff was a product of Monarch Releasing Corporation and had been filmed in Argentina in 1971 as Slaughter, a film about bad girls, motorcycles, and bad guys. Slaughter was so ineptly made as to be unreleasable. Five years later, the head of Monarch breathed new life into this terrible piece by splicing on five minutes of additional footage, releasing it as Snuff, and spreading the word this was an actual snuff film.",12,Snuff Films,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/a-pinch-of-snuff/,false,Snuff films — are they for real?,Barbara Mikkelson,1999-02-27,Films are routinely made for entertainment purposes in which participants are murdered on camera.

The duo are perhaps most famous for investigating a haunted house in New York in 1975. That investigation inspired the book ""The Amityville Horror"" and several films of the same name. The pair also investigated reports about a Raggedy Ann Doll that was supposedly possessed by a young girl named Annabelle Higgins.

"Oleander is a common outdoor woody shrub found in warmer climates, often used for edging freeways or gardens. It is also quite poisonous, with the ingestion of as little as a single leaf reportedly being enough to kill a child.

"According to this well-traveled cautionary tale, the unwitting use of oleander branches or leaves in a campfire brings about the death of a group of people either through roasting sticks fashioned from the plant adding a fatal kick to cookout ingestibles or the leaves or branches used to feed the flames creating a deadly cloud of poisonous smoke. Because this is a legend meant to make a point about the danger posed by this particular plant so that those exposed to the tale will afterwards be more careful about their use of plants in the wild, the victims are presented as folks with whom listeners will sympathize: a troop of Boy Scouts or a vacationing family (which implies the presence, and thus the demise, of small children). The use of sympathetic characters makes for a loss deemed especially tragic and adds to the pathos of the story, which in turn helps ensure that the tale better sticks in memory and so makes for a more effective teaching device. Likewise, in this legend the element of horror is raised to the highest possible level in that everyone in the group exposed to the oleander dies: not one Boy Scout survives the hot dogging, nor does any member of the luckless family live through their exposure to the acrid smoke.

"How poisonous is poisonous? Oleander (leaves and branches) is deemed extremely dangerous, with the poison known to affect the heart, produce severe digestive upset, and to have caused death. The size and relative health of the person ingesting the plant have a great deal to do with the severity of the poisoning. Their relatively small body size places children especially at risk, making oleander a plant one may not want in one's garden if children are part of the household or live nearby.",10,Oleander Poisoning,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/fatal-wienie-roast/,legend,Did a troop of Boy Scouts die after roasting hot dogs on oleander branches?,Barbara Mikkelson,2003-09-24,A troop of Boy Scouts dies after roasting hot dogs on oleander sticks.

The most contaminated hot dog contained 1.5 mg oleandrin; even allowing for other unmeasured cardiac glycosides, this oleandrin content is orders of magnitude lower than that expected to cause human toxicity if the hot dogs were consumed.

Environmental interventions, improvements in nutrition, advances in clinical medicine, improvements in access to health care, improvements in surveillance and monitoring of disease, increases in education levels, and improvements in standards of living contributed to this remarkable decline.

"On 31 January 2013, Canadian student Elisa Lam was last seen alive by an employee of the Hotel Cecil in Los Angeles.

"On 14 February 2013, surveillance video from the Hotel Cecil in Los Angeles was released by police; in those lengthy clips, Lam was seen lingering in an elevator and behaving in an unusual fashion. Many viewers of the unsettling clips inferred Lam was interacting with an unknown person or persons off camera, while others suspected the young woman was experiencing an episode of acute mental illness or was under the influence of drugs",3,The Strange Death of Elisa Lam,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-of-elisa-lam/,true,"A young woman named Elisa Lam disappeared under mysterious circumstances in Los Angeles in 2013, her body later found in a hotel's rooftop water tank.",David Mikkelson,2016-08-14,"A young woman named Elisa Lam disappeared under mysterious circumstances in Los Angeles, her body later found in a hotel's water tank."
"Five days after the release of the videos, the hotel began to investigate guest complaints of low water pressure and an odd taste in the water supply, and maintenance workers located a body, later identified as that of Elisa Lam, in one of four large water tanks on the roof of the Hotel Cecil.

"In June 2013, Lt. Fred Corral of the Los Angeles County coroner's office investigations division confirmed Elisa Lam's cause of death was accidental, with bipolar disorder as a significant condition.

"In the time since Elisa Lam's mysterious death, the enduring questions she left behind have been the source of speculation. Adding to the uneasiness many have about Lam's demise is the checkered history of the Hotel Cecil, where a woman leapt to her death from the roof in the 1960s and serial killer Richard Ramirez (the ""Night Stalker"") lived for a time in the mid-1980s.",6,The Strange Death of Elisa Lam,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-of-elisa-lam/,true,"A young woman named Elisa Lam disappeared under mysterious circumstances in Los Angeles in 2013, her body later found in a hotel's rooftop water tank.",David Mikkelson,2016-08-14,"A young woman named Elisa Lam disappeared under mysterious circumstances in Los Angeles, her body later found in a hotel's water tank."
"One of the aspects of the Elisa Lam's disappearance and death that has fed continuing interest in the case is its trajectory and unresolved aspects. Given that Lam was initially one of a number of missing students at the time, her disappearance didn't draw much attention until the release of surveillance video by the LAPD in February 2013. Even then, it wasn't until the unusual circumstances of her death by drowning were revealed that media interest in Lam's case surged.

"The ""ecstasy in Halloween candy"" warning appeared to be a variant of age-old rumors about poison (and other dangerous substances) being randomly handed out to children in trick-or-treat loot, a persistent but largely baseless fear that's dogged Halloween celebrations for decades.

"Excessive concern over colorful drugs (such as strawberry meth) either making their way into the hands of kids or being manufactured to appeal to them isn't a new concern either: tales circulated in the 1970s claiming LSD merchants were targeting children by peddling their wares via attractive temporary tattoos. By sharp contrast, dire warnings about drugs designed with a candy-like appearance intended to ""hook"" kids have never come true — which stands to reason, as schoolchildren aren't the most promising market for illicit recreational drugs. (LSD and MDMA also are largely not addictive substances.)",4,Ecstasy in Halloween Candy?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ecstasy-halloween-candy/,mostly false,"Despite Facebook warnings, there's little reason to expect drug-laced Gummi bears and Ecstasy tablets will be found in kids' trick-or-treat bags this Halloween.",Kim LaCapria,2015-09-28,Parents should keep any eye out for drug-laced Gummy bears and ecstasy (MDMA) disguised as Halloween candy being distributed to trick-or-treaters.
"As is often the case with such rumors, the public seemed to conflate the existence of a drug that looked child-friendly (such as blue star tattoos, pink meth, or colorful MDMA tablets) with deliberate manufacture of those substances with an intent to attract children.

"An important distinction to bear in mind is that the MDMA depicted is not a new form designed to appeal to children: MDMA tablets have historically been produced with a variety of shapes and colors befitting its status as a ""party drug."" Another is that recreational drugs (including MDMA) are generally expensive. The small collection of pills depicted here represents a street value of hundreds of dollars, so the notion that a neighbor would be distributing them to trick-or-treaters for no ostensible reason is rather implausible (especially given how many drug users tend to carefully guard their stashes and often won't readily share them with friends, much less randomly-selected small children).

"The strange and spooky tale of a town known as Ashley, Kansas (and the fate of its more than 670 residents) after an anomalous incident in 1952 has circulated the Internet for several years. In terms of unexplained events, it's an interesting narrative: a middle-of-the-night earthquake followed weeks of strange happenings; and the town of Ashley — along with everyone who lived there — abruptly disappeared. But if you search for any historical mention of Ashley, Kansas, you'll come up short.

At 3:28am on August 17, 1952, a magnitude 7.9 earthquake was measured by the United States Geological Survey. The earthquake itself was felt throughout the state and most of the midwest.

All the shit I see in other peoples blogs is ridiculous. That they committed suicide, were on PCP. Really, your that bored? Bored enough to make up shit you have no idea what really happened?

"The photographs remained popular in part due to the overwhelming assumption that the dead men were clearly up to no good (i.e., stealing copper, and presumably interfering with vital electrical systems) when they met their ends. While the nature of the images was both upsetting and graphic, viewers felt uncharacteristically comfortable sharing them",4,Dallas Copper Bandits,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dallas-copper-thieves/,undetermined,Rumor: A graphic image set illustrates the gruesome fates of two copper thieves in Dallas.,David Mikkelson,2015-04-17,A graphic image set illustrates the gruesome fates of two copper thieves in Dallas.
"During American discussions of the photos, commenters predominantly stated that the incident shown had occurred at a ""Dallas sub-station"" and happened ""a few months back,"" though some commenters chimed in to claim the incident as local to them in other states. The photographs appeared in September 2009 on a Hungarian web site, and in that version the dead men were identified as ""Roma youth"" (presumably local to page's creator).

As for the second photograph in the current item's image pair, it appears to be a screenshot taken from a graphic video of indeterminate origin published to YouTube on 24 August 2012.

"It's certainly possible that the child depicted in the video died in the manner claimed, but the appearance of the boy shown in the video does not seem consistent with that of an electrocution death.

"Whenever electricity is in use, a possibility of malfunction and shock always exists to some degree. A young child, toddler, or baby should never be left alone with electrical devices or cords of any description. According to the CDC [PDF], the leading cause of death for infants and toddlers is unintentional injury. Suffocation, motor vehicle accidents, drowning, fires, and ingestion of poisonous substances are listed as the primary forms of death from unintentional injury in babies and toddlers.",6,Baby Killed by Electric Shock from Cord,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/shock-schlocktrine/,mostly false,Rumor: Image depicts a toddler who was electrocuted after playing with an electrical cord.,David Mikkelson,2015-03-31,Image depicts a toddler who was electrocuted after playing with an electrical cord.
"So while it may be possible for a child to die of electric shock due to a (likelier than not malfunctioning) phone charger, the little boy depicted in the first photo did not die that way. Moreover, cords present a far larger risk of death from suffocation than shock and can pose a threat of strangulation as well as electrocution.

"Origins: On 15 October 2014, social media lit up with a seemingly implausible tale. An Australian man named Dylan Maxwell (Thomas) quickly became the subject of international buzz (via Facebook) after he asserted that during his vacation trip to Bali, a spider burrowed under his skin
and had to be surgically removed. Maxwell's frightening arachnic story was picked up by news outlets in Australia, then Europe, and eventually in the U.S. Images sourced from Thomas' Facebook circulated as well via news outlets on Twitter and Facebook:",1,Spider Lives in Man's Scar?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bali-awry/,probably false,A vacationing man discovered that increasing pain he was experiencing was due to a tropical spider's living under his skin?,David Mikkelson,2014-10-16,A vacationing man discovered that increasing pain he was experiencing was due to a tropical spider's living under his skin.
"Bunbury local Dylan Thomas' first trip to Bali was complete with a visit to the Bali International Medical Centre to have a tropical spider pulled out of his stomach. 21-year-old Dylan awoke after a quiet night in his four and a half star hotel room to find a bizarre red trail two inches from his naval [sic] and heading upwards. ""It was as if someone had scratched me with the tip of a knife,"" he said. Later that evening, the trail had moved two or three inches higher. When a concerned Dylan fronted up to the doctors, they told him it was a small insect bite, and gave him some antihistamine cream to rub on the red line. Later that morning he awoke to blisters. “That's when it became painful, it was a searing burn,” he said. He finally saw a dermatologist, who told him that it was something out of the ordinary. Doctors extracted a tropical spider that had burrowed itself into the scar from Dylan's recent appendix removal. The doctors put the spider in a container and took it away for testing. Dylan will be informed next week as to what kind of spider made home in his body for three days.",2,Spider Lives in Man's Scar?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bali-awry/,probably false,A vacationing man discovered that increasing pain he was experiencing was due to a tropical spider's living under his skin?,David Mikkelson,2014-10-16,A vacationing man discovered that increasing pain he was experiencing was due to a tropical spider's living under his skin.
"Moreover, all the information contained in that article came from Maxwell himself, thus unleashing on the Internet that bane of fact-checkers: the single-source, self-reported, uncorroborated implausible story.

"The larval form of the Megalopyge opercularis species of moth is found primarily in the southeastern United States (largely in Texas, Louisiana, and Florida) and goes by a number of common names, including the southern flannel moth caterpillar, pussy moth caterpillar, puss caterpillar, tree asp, and the asp caterpillar. The asp (as we'll refer to it here) somewhat resembles a colored ball of cotton and is venomous not in the sense that it bites, but in that it is covered in fur-like spines that contain venom that can cause varying forms of distress to humans who come into contact with them. The peak months of envenomation are July through November, and symptoms of envenomation typically include burning pain, swelling, nausea, and itching.",2,Is This a Photograph of a Venomous 'Asp' Caterpillar?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/venomous-asp-caterpillar/,true,This deceptively fluffy-looking caterpillar has a painful sting.,David Mikkelson,2014-09-07,Photographs show a venomous caterpillar known as an asp.
"Asp caterpillars pose a seasonal health hazard. Intense, throbbing pain develops immediately or within five minutes of contact with the caterpillar. Stings on the arm may also result in pain in the armpit region. Erythematous (blood- colored) spots typically appear at the site of the sting. Other symptoms can include headaches, nausea, vomiting, intense abdominal distress, lymphadenopathy, lymphadenitis, and sometimes shock or respiratory stress. Pain usually subsides within an hour and spots disappear in a day or so; however, with a larger dose of the venom, it is not uncommon for the symptoms to last several days or longer.",3,Is This a Photograph of a Venomous 'Asp' Caterpillar?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/venomous-asp-caterpillar/,true,This deceptively fluffy-looking caterpillar has a painful sting.,David Mikkelson,2014-09-07,Photographs show a venomous caterpillar known as an asp.
"Often, those envenomated by the asp caterpillar find that health care professionals have never seen nor heard of the creature; the caregivers are left with little to go on, and the victims are left with the distress of an unknown prognosis. Existing literature often involves a single case study, a self-reported envenomation, or a handful of cases. The need for better information about these caterpillars is not purely academic: at times public schools in Texas have been temporarily shut down because of outbreaks of the caterpillar, and more generally the problem of ignorance in the medical community can lead to under-treatment or mistreatment.",4,Is This a Photograph of a Venomous 'Asp' Caterpillar?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/venomous-asp-caterpillar/,true,This deceptively fluffy-looking caterpillar has a painful sting.,David Mikkelson,2014-09-07,Photographs show a venomous caterpillar known as an asp.
"Megalopyge opercularis, commonly known in Texas as an ""asp"" is one of the most toxic caterpillars in North America. Also known as puss moth caterpillars, the larva are teardrop shaped from 1 to 1.5 inches long. Although called a stinging caterpillar, the venom is actually in spines connected to a poison sac and concealed by the outer hairy surface. When touched they break off and remain in the skin releasing the venom.",5,Is This a Photograph of a Venomous 'Asp' Caterpillar?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/venomous-asp-caterpillar/,true,This deceptively fluffy-looking caterpillar has a painful sting.,David Mikkelson,2014-09-07,Photographs show a venomous caterpillar known as an asp.
"Intense throbbing pain develops within five minutes of contact with pain extending up the affected arm. Other symptoms may include headaches, nausea, vomiting, intense abdominal distress, lymphadenopathy, lymphadenitis, and sometimes shock or respiratory stress. Erythematous spots or hemorrhagic papules may appear at the site of the sting and last for 1-5 days. Some of the more unusual presentations have been in children where they have gotten into the mouth and deposited spines and venom in the mucus tissues. These spines can persist and one researcher describes the experience of removing shoes after being in an infected area and transferring a spine from the shoe to the eye causing severe pain. The number of exposures peaks in June-July with a second peak in October. One researcher reported that there may be two generations within a year. The poison control centers report that about one fourth to one third of the patients experience intensive pain that radiates up the arm or leg. The pain is severe enough for some patients to believe they are having a heart attack.

The use of adhesive tape to remove the spines that remain on the skin is recommended. Wash the area with soap and water to remove any remaining venom. Prompt application of an ice pack and a baking soda poultice should help reduce pain and swelling. Over the counter analgesics appear to be ineffective for reducing pain and headache. Oral administration of antihistamines may help relieve itching and burning following up with topical corticosteroids to reduce intensity of inflammation.,7,Is This a Photograph of a Venomous 'Asp' Caterpillar?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/venomous-asp-caterpillar/,true,This deceptively fluffy-looking caterpillar has a painful sting.,David Mikkelson,2014-09-07,Photographs show a venomous caterpillar known as an asp.

"Origins: Our oldest sighting of this urban legend about a teenage girl spotting her putative killer's reflection in the glass of a door or window dates to 2000, yet this campfire tale may be older still. This yarn of grisly murder barely averted always takes place on a snowy or rainy night when the teen girl is either on her own or has a younger sibling or two in the house with her. When armed, the would-be attacker is wielding a knife or a meat cleaver, implements sure to produce a gruesome end to anyone they're used on. When she spots the menacing face in the window, the girl attempts to shield herself from the man's gaze by hiding under a blanket.

"While this is a tale meant to speed icy fingers down one's spine, it's likely pure fiction.

"In common with all ""murdering madmen"" legends, the prey is female and the stalker male.

"Why the shorthand, the exaggeration of the imbalance? Upon hearing any of these legends, we mentally cast ourselves in the role of the person it happened to. By making the mythical victim appear both especially at risk and not all that capable of protecting herself, we more clearly express our own fears of the world around us and our personal sense of being vulnerable to attack.",8,Killer's Reflection,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/upon-reflection/,legend,Wet footprints behind the sofa prove that a teen babysitter barely escaped from a knife-wielding intruder.,Barbara Mikkelson,2013-06-11,Wet footprints behind the sofa prove that a teen babysitter barely escaped from a knife-wielding intruder.
"This legend about wet footprints behind the sofa shares a key theme with some other urban legends, notably The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs, wherein a teenage babysitter eludes a killer hiding upstairs, and The Clown Statue, wherein another teen babysitter barely escapes a killer masquerading as a clown statue in one of the children's rooms. In each of these legends, a teen girl only just avoids being horribly massacred by a stranger lurking in the house.",9,Killer's Reflection,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/upon-reflection/,legend,Wet footprints behind the sofa prove that a teen babysitter barely escaped from a knife-wielding intruder.,Barbara Mikkelson,2013-06-11,Wet footprints behind the sofa prove that a teen babysitter barely escaped from a knife-wielding intruder.

"Origins: An incident in May 2012 involving a confrontation between two naked men in Miami in which one tried to chew off the face of the other before being shot by police led to myriad comparisons and jokes about the event being an indicator of an impending ""zombie apocalypse."" One such jape was that the dead face-eating man had not been high on bath salts (a form of drug) as originally reported (further investigation revealed marijuana but no bath salts in his system) but had been infected with LQP-79, a virus that supposedly ""destroys internal organs and affects the brain waves to make you hungry for human flesh,"" as described in the following spoof (created by altering a related Huffington Post article):",1,LQP-79 Zombie Virus,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lqp-79-zombie-virus/,false,A virus known as LQP-79 produces 'zombie-like' cannibalistic behavior in humans?,David Mikkelson,2012-05-31,"A virus known as LQP-79 produces ""zombie-like"" cannibalistic behavior in humans."

"Hello I am Trinity's mother and wanted to let you know the story of how this happened. Trinity had an accident and at the time I was washing pretty much every thing she owned and the new sleeper I bought was just laying on her rocker chair beside me so I decide to just slip it on. No she never cryed or acted like anything was up. A little while later she got a little fussy and I went to change her. When I pulled her foot out she started crying and that is when I noticed the razor it came out when I pulled her leg out. I instantly panicied and started to check her legs and foot and that is when I noticed the little cuts and the one pretty good one on the side of her foot. They had all just happened I didn't know there was something like that in there or could even be possible. I would lay down my life for my daughter I love her more than anything in this world and I have cryed and blamed myself enough over this. I would never do anything to hurt this baby! I have not took any legal action and I place no blaim anywhere but if there is some sicko out there... I am just trying to let parents know that dangers like this are out there and can happened. Also My daughter is 10 months old and pushes her own legs in to her sleepers with no trouble at all. Also the ER doctor said even if I would have washed it, chances are in would not have fallin out or worse got caught in some other type of clothing or blanket and caused a much worse cut to her.

Because of the headaches she could not concentrate at work and was sleeping very poorly. she went back to her doctor who decided to examine her scalp and under the beautiful weave he found worms! The worms were burrowing into her skull and after sending the samples to the lab they found that the hair had eggs from which the worms had hatched!

"A Brazilian weave (which is not to be confused with a Brazilian blowout, a treatment performed in a salon whereby the customer's own hair is chemically de-frizzed) is constructed of hair extensions made from human hair. The customer's own tresses are first worked into cornrows, which then serve as the platform onto which the extensions are sewn. The resulting ""weave"" sits atop the recipient's own hair, somewhat akin to a wig that's been sewn into place. The procedure takes between four and five hours to complete, and prices in the $1,000 to $2,000 range are not unheard of.",5,Hair Weave Worms,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-writhing-weave/,false,Weave made from dead person's hair causes worms to grow in recipient's scalp.,Barbara Mikkelson,2010-11-04,Weave made from dead person's hair causes worms to grow in recipient's scalp.

"The results described are also impossible. Popular belief to the contrary, human corpses are not riddled with worms. Rather, once people die, their bodies very quickly attract the attention of a number of species of flies, which (among other activities) lay their eggs on the deceased. The ""worms"" one sometimes sees on corpses are actually maggots, the just-hatched offspring of such flies. Human hair intended for weaves, hair pieces, or wigs is carefully washed, sorted, and matched with tresses of similar color and texture very early in the process of turning it into a fashion accessory. Ergo, even if the hair used had been taken from a corpse and had through that association become infested with fly eggs, those future larvae (""worms"") would have been washed away by the first cleaning given those strands during the sorting process.",8,Hair Weave Worms,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-writhing-weave/,false,Weave made from dead person's hair causes worms to grow in recipient's scalp.,Barbara Mikkelson,2010-11-04,Weave made from dead person's hair causes worms to grow in recipient's scalp.
"The hair weave tale combines three urban legends into one. From the ""poisoned dress"" legend, it draws the element of an item taken from a corpse (a dress in one story, hair in the other) transmitting some manner of horribleness (formaldehyde or worms) to the next wearer. From the ""necrophiliac lover"" legend comes the plot device of a doctor's running tests on the maggots, thereby discovering that the hair used in the weave had come from a dead person. Tying it all together is the ""fatal hairdo"" legend, wherein a gal's unwashed bouffant hair style becomes the home for venomous spiders that serve to punish both her vanity and lack of attention to matters of personal hygiene.",9,Hair Weave Worms,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-writhing-weave/,false,Weave made from dead person's hair causes worms to grow in recipient's scalp.,Barbara Mikkelson,2010-11-04,Weave made from dead person's hair causes worms to grow in recipient's scalp.
"There are numerous meanings to the hair weave tale, two of which are contained in its closing: ""Lesson: ladies we should be careful with what we put on our heads, it is better to appreciate our natural beauty and be content with what God has blessed us with than to chase artificial beauty."" First, the story is one of caveat emptor, a ""buyer beware"" tale wherein a woman comes by her headful of maggots via opting for the latest, greatest hair treatment. In that light, it's meant to impress upon us, its audience, that we never truly know what goes into consumer products and thus should exercise care in our choices. Second, the story is one that decries vanity, in this instance by portraying a gal who disregards the ""better to be happy with what we have"" dictum in favor of an enormously expensive beauty adjunct as paying for her narcissism in gruesome fashion. Vanity is further highlighted as evil by the audience's awareness that if the woman had been able to wash her own hair (which she couldn't, because it was under the weave), those fly eggs would have been long gone well before they had turned into ""worms"" that started chomping on her. Xenophobia also comes into play, as the hair used in Brazilian weaves generally comes from abroad: by portraying the imported tresses as maggot-laden and dangerous, ongoing suspicion about things which come from other countries and cultures is aired. Last, the story reflects our unease with the dead.",10,Hair Weave Worms,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-writhing-weave/,false,Weave made from dead person's hair causes worms to grow in recipient's scalp.,Barbara Mikkelson,2010-11-04,Weave made from dead person's hair causes worms to grow in recipient's scalp.

"Origins: Just as hula hoops, yo-yos, Tamagotchis, and Pokemon cards were the playground fads for their generations, Silly Bandz have become ""must have"" items of the day for today's younger set.

"These pliable bands (which were first sold online in late 2008 and achieved widespread popularity in the fall of 2009) have been banned from some classrooms, camps, and swimming pools. Such injunctions have more to do with the enthusiasm of children for these playthings than out of concern for any danger they might pose: kids wanted to continue comparing and trading bands with their schoolmates even after class began, and they have found it fun to shoot elastics around the room, especially colored and oddly-shaped ones. (Additionally, some school pool facilities have reported problems with the bands' clogging up drains.)

"While Silly Bandz are quite stretchy, they are still capable of constricting blood flow if arms are loaded with too many of these circlets and for too long. The formation of blood clots is a potential possible outcome, as is phlebitis, an inflammation of a vein.

"Origins: 
In August 2010 news about the impending opening of a restaurant in Germany shocked the sensibilities of many around the world. According to Der Spiegel, a weekly magazine with a circulation in excess of 1 million readers, a restaurant was soon to open in Berlin wherein mankind's strongest taboo, the eating of human flesh, would be violated. Offering ""Wari cuisine"" (the Wari were an Amazonian tribe that practiced ritualistic consumption of the honored dead), Flimé, the proposed eatery, was using its web site to seek donors of body parts as well as advertise for the services of an ""open-minded surgeon.""",1,Cannibal Restaurant Hoax,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/flesh-potted/,false,A Berlin restaurant plans to offer meals made from human body parts?,Barbara Mikkelson,2010-09-05,A Berlin restaurant plans to offer meals made from human body parts.
"After allowing the press chew on the story for a week, on 2 September 2010 the group behind the web site came clean: The cannibal restaurant wasn't real; it existed only in the imagination of the Association of German Vegetarians (VEBU). The web site — its entreaty for body parts and an open-minded surgeon included — had been a publicity stunt intended to showcase the group's belief that all consumption of meat is cannibalism, in that ""Eating animals is like consuming people,"" and ""Every piece of meat is a piece of mankind."" The group said through the Flimé web site that ""The more severe the reactions to the Flimé have been, the better.""",2,Cannibal Restaurant Hoax,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/flesh-potted/,false,A Berlin restaurant plans to offer meals made from human body parts?,Barbara Mikkelson,2010-09-05,A Berlin restaurant plans to offer meals made from human body parts.

"Taboos against eating one's own are universal, which is why cannibalism is such an attractive topic for hoaxsters, prank artists, or those looking to draw attention to their particular causes or artistic endeavors. In 2001, photos of a Chinese man chowing down on what appeared to be a roast infant accompanied by the claim that such cannibalizations were ""Taiwan's hottest food"" and that ""dead babies or fetuses could be bought at $50 to $70 from hospitals to meet the high demand for grilled and barbecued babies"" rocketed through the Internet. The truth, however, was far less shocking: The people of Taiwan view the eating of people with as much abhorrence as those of anywhere else; and the ""grilled baby"" pictured was likely fabricated from sticking a doll's head onto a roast duck; and the photo had been the work of Chinese artist Zhu Yu, who performed a conceptual piece titled ""Eating People"" at a Shanghai arts festival in 2000.",4,Cannibal Restaurant Hoax,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/flesh-potted/,false,A Berlin restaurant plans to offer meals made from human body parts?,Barbara Mikkelson,2010-09-05,A Berlin restaurant plans to offer meals made from human body parts.

Falls Fire Department told us in August 2010 that the fire was still under investigation and no determination as to its cause has yet been made.

"Captain Doebler confirmed during our phone call with him that the fire began in the bedroom used by the deceased, and that both a cell phone and laptop computer were present in that room. However, that these two items were found in the room where the fire started does not necessarily mean either of these electronic devices caused the fire. House fires can start in many ways, including electrical malfunctions in a home's wiring.

"Laptops have occasionally touched off house fires, but in instances where the distinct causes were known, the majority of incidents involved mechanical flaws in the units or their batteries — otherwise-robust laptops do not as a rule start fires even when their air intake vents are blocked. Moreover, nearly all major-manufacturer laptop CPUs now include automatic thermal shutdowns to prevent them from overheating, so the possibility that a properly functioning laptop could ignite a housefire are virtually nil. Therefore, the key factor about the e-mailed caution is that it misleadingly uses the circumstances of the death of Arun Gopalratnam to assert that any laptop (not just ones with faulty batteries or suspect wiring) could cause similar deadly fires if used on surfaces that compromised their air vents, such as beds or pillows.",9,Fatal Laptop Fire,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/fatal-laptop-fire/,mixture,An overheated laptop in a bed caused a fatal house fire?,Barbara Mikkelson,2010-08-17,An overheated laptop used in a bed caused a fatal house fire.

"Third, there's the matter of the eggs.

If the mom-to-be is a German cockroach, she carries it around until its contents hatch, but if she's an American cockroach, she ports it about for a day or two until it hardens and darkens and then hides it in a crevice covered with camouflage she glues in place with saliva.",12,Cockroach Eggs in Drinking Straws,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/straw-bedded/,false,Do cockroach eggs in drinking straws pose a general danger to restaurant patrons?,Barbara Mikkelson,2010-03-22,Cockroach eggs in drinking straws pose a general danger to restaurant patrons.

"The most common form taken by the ""Vanishing Hitchhiker"" legend involves a driver who stops to pick up a strange girl on a highway, then during the course of the ride realizes his guest has disappeared.

"However, that legend also exists in a secondary version which similarly features a hitchhiker who dematerializes from a moving car, but only after solemnly intoning a prophecy. Good crops, the end of a war, a natural catastrophe about to strike, or the imminent coming of Jesus have been predicted by these vanishing prophets. Common to many of these tales is the completing element of the baffled and somewhat unsettled driver's reporting the incident to police or other authorities, only to be told he's the fourth or fifth person that week to have announced having had such an encounter. That element is a plot device necessary to the believability of the story: Without the confirmation from an authority figure that others have shared the same experience, those being regaled with the yarn could quietly conclude the person who heard the prophecy and witnessed its deliverer vanish from the car was off his rocker.",2,Prophetic Vanishing Hitchhiker,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-vanishing-prophet/,legend,"Hitchhiker utters prophecy about Judgment Day being upon us, then vanishes?",Barbara Mikkelson,2009-05-02,"Hitchhiker utters prophecy about Judgment Day being upon us, then vanishes."

Alternatively, they are also often said to have done something indicating they were angels (e.g., saying ""My lips are near the trumpet,"" a statement meant to identify its speaker as the archangel Gabriel).

"Beginning yesterday afternoon, it was discovered that someone replaced the hand soap in the men's restrooms with an unknown substance. The first reported incident was near I-10 at the Alabama Welcome Center in Baldwin County. Testing is being carried out by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management. This morning another incident occurred in Chilton County (b/w Montgomery and Birmingham) on I-65 where the
employee noticed that the hand soap container had been tampered with. Upon further inspection, the employee discovered that jugs in the storage area appeared to have the same material added. Sample substance appears to be acid but is enroute to the Alabama Department of Public Health for testing. It appears that Florida may have two incidents of the same nature.

The fear that through no fault of our own we'll innocently end up victims of random tampering underpins a number of baseless Internet-fueled scares, including the 2000 panic about HIV-laden syringes being affixed to gas pump handles and 2004 concern about HIV-positive blood being slipped into fast food ketchup dispensers.",3,Acid in Hand Soap,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hand-soap-warning/,false,Acid was placed into in hand soap dispensers in the restrooms of rest stops in Alabama and Florida?,Barbara Mikkelson,2009-03-14,Acid was placed into in hand soap dispensers in the restrooms of rest stops in Alabama and Florida.

"Origins: This warning has been in circulation since mid-November 2008, and while it is true that razors have sometimes been discovered lying loose among merchandise at the Wal-Mart in Lewistown, Pennsylvania, we could not verify the specific account given above. When we called the Wal-Mart store in question and asked about the e-mail, we were told that neither a customer nor any of the sales associates working at that location had reported such an incident to the store's manager. They acknowledged that yes, razor blades have occasionally been found lying loose about the store, but",1,Razor Blades in Merchandise,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/blade-runner/,partly true,"Razor blades found in products sold at Wal-Mart in Lewistown, Pennsylvania?",Barbara Mikkelson,2008-12-02,"Razor blades have been found amidst merchandise sold at a Wal-Mart store in Lewistown, Pennsylvania."
"In general, the finding of loose razor blades or other cutting implements around retail stores is a known occasional occurrence. The inclusion of anti-theft measures on easily stealable items has prompted some shoplifters to cut merchandise out of its packaging while they are still in the store. This practice sometimes involves first appropriating razor blades or Exacto knives from that same store, using those implements to free desired items from their casings or store security tags, then discarding the tools used to open the packaging. These discards can be quite haphazard: razor blades or knives are shoved onto shelves or stashed among packaged merchandise, with little thought given to the safety of other shoppers. As to what sort of goods these thieves are after, it's everything from CDs and small electronics to cough and cold medications and weight loss formulations — anything of value that is either in a clamshell casing or has a security tag affixed to it is a target. Shoplifters, as anyone in retail well knows, will steal just about anything.",2,Razor Blades in Merchandise,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/blade-runner/,partly true,"Razor blades found in products sold at Wal-Mart in Lewistown, Pennsylvania?",Barbara Mikkelson,2008-12-02,"Razor blades have been found amidst merchandise sold at a Wal-Mart store in Lewistown, Pennsylvania."
"It's also the case that employees who restock store shelves typically use various types of bladed instruments to open boxes and cartons, and they too may sometimes drop, lose, or accidentally leave blades from such implements in areas where shoppers might later encounter them.",3,Razor Blades in Merchandise,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/blade-runner/,partly true,"Razor blades found in products sold at Wal-Mart in Lewistown, Pennsylvania?",Barbara Mikkelson,2008-12-02,"Razor blades have been found amidst merchandise sold at a Wal-Mart store in Lewistown, Pennsylvania."
"The bottom line is that while the incident recounted above may not have been confirmed, razor blades and similar sharp instruments that have been discarded by shoplifters (or lost by employees) are occasionally found in various retail establishments. There is therefore no protection to be gained by thinking the problem is limited to just one store at one particular location: If consumers need to be concerned about random encounters with slicing implements during their shopping forays, they need to be concerned about them in every store, not just the one named in an e-mail. However, the good news is that such finds are infrequent rather than commonplace. Ergo, while this sort of thing can happen and has happened, it's neither a new nor a common phenomenon, so you need not attempt to break any speed records in warning everyone you know about it.",4,Razor Blades in Merchandise,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/blade-runner/,partly true,"Razor blades found in products sold at Wal-Mart in Lewistown, Pennsylvania?",Barbara Mikkelson,2008-12-02,"Razor blades have been found amidst merchandise sold at a Wal-Mart store in Lewistown, Pennsylvania."

"It's often the case, however, that aspects of such original works become obscured by the innumerable derivatives they spawn: Elements enter the popular ""lore"" of a genre not because they were present in the progenitor work, but because they were introduced somewhere along the line in films, plays, sequels, modern updatings, or other types of adaptations.

This isn't the case in Stoker's novel: Even though Jonathan Harker muses in his journal (in Chapter 4) that ""I have not yet seen the Count in the daylight.

"The motif of destruction by sunlight was introduced in the 1922 silent film Nosferatu, loosely based on Stoker's novel. Although this innovation was not adopted in the 1931 [Bela Lugosi film version of] Dracula, it resurfaced in the Hammer [Studios' Horror of Dracula] production of 1958, in which Peter Cushing dramatically pulls open the drapes to expose Christopher Lee to the deadly rays of the sun. Another variation appears in 1979, when Dracula (Frank Langella) is hoisted into the sunlight where he disintegrates. The film most faithful to Stoker in this respect is Bram Stoker's Dracula: the Count (Gary Oldman) moves about freely during daylight, but with reduced powers.",13,Is Dracula Killed with a Wooden Stake?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dracula/,false,You may be surprised by how Dracula is actually dispatched in Bram Stoker's iconic vampire novel.,David Mikkelson,2008-10-30,Bram Stoker's novel 'Dracula' features a titular vampire who cannot expose himself to sunlight and is killed with a wooden stake.

""This product may cause suffocation or hypothermia,"" the warning reads. The Korea Consumer Protection Board advises that ""Doors should be left open when sleeping with the electric fan or air conditioner turned on. If bodies are exposed to electric fans or air conditioners for too long, it causes bodies to lose water and hypothermia.""

In South Korea, a country that gets hot and humid in the summer, many homes will contain electric fans which, with their owners now dead, will be still running in the morning when the bodies are discovered.

More than two-thirds of hair dyes currently contain PPD or related chemicals, which means the former tattoo wearer may well experience a delayed hypersensitivity reaction when she decides years later to change her hair color.

Michael, still working in Alabama, called today with some upsetting news, and to ask for special prayer for a young man that is employed at the plant there in Tuscaloosa. Late Tuesday afternoon, the young man was out in the yard playing ball with his two boys, (ages 6 & 8 I think). When the youngest boy missed the ball, he ran under the deck to retrieve it. When the little fellow screamed, the oldest boy ran to help out, then he screamed. Both boys had been bitten several times by rattle snakes. The ball had landed in the middle of a snake bed. A 911 call was made, but the couple was afraid the boys would not make it. The two boys were placed in the family car in an attempt to ""beat the clock"". In all the excitement of trying to hurry, the young father ran over his 3 year old daughter in the driveway. Michael says in 21 minutes all three children were dead !!

"Family members say San Francisco stockbroker Jack Sullivan followed a pattern in his life, and the one day he broke the routine it killed him. A beautiful San Francisco day persuaded Sullivan to take his normal Sunday jog a day early on a different route. The path he chose below the Lincoln Park golf course was a treacherous one, and Sullivan apparently misjudged it. Witnesses saw him jog down the coastal trail next to the 17th hole, turn and run off the cliff at the Eagle Point overlook. His body was found 200 feet below. [Sullivan's wife] said she was convinced her husband hadn't committed suicide, saying he was happy with his life and had made plans to play golf with a friend the following day. A more likely explanation, she said, is that her husband wasn't concentrating on the path because he was collecting his thoughts and making plans.

"Urban legends are sometimes used as dark vehicles for communicating the potential worst outcomes of seemingly unremarkable acts. In the hope that those regaled with the starkly unforgiving mental images they invoke will be inspired to exercise greater care in the presence of risks they hadn't previously perceived, the creators of these tales use vivid imagery to make their points, painting in broad strokes gruesome pictures of hauntingly memorable tragedies. In this vein, the caution to not stick one's head out a moving vehicle's window becomes (in the canon of urban lore) a blood-soaked tale about a little girl on a school bus who is beheaded by a road sign, and misgivings about the relative safety of popular dance moves becomes a story about a boy who ""leaned with it, rocked with it"" a little too exuberantly, causing his neck to snap like a dry twig.",1,Baby Smothered Under Pile of Coats?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/coat-check/,legend,Tragic tale tells of a baby left on a bed who is smothered under coats carelessly dropped by Christmas guests.,Barbara Mikkelson,2007-01-02,A baby left on a bed is smothered under coats dropped by Christmas visitors.

After a brief time of fellowship, the couple, who were anxiously anticipating the christening of their child on the next morning, announced to those who had gathered, ""We want you to meet our little one who is the object of our celebration this evening.""

In questioning panic, she left the room and rushed into the master bedroom where she had left her baby asleep in the middle of their large bed. There on the bed she found a huge pile of the guests' coats. The mother rushed to them and began to fling them aside as she clawed down to the bottom of the pile.

"Although the stories recounted above of careless partygoers' causing the death of a sleeping infant by unthinkingly piling their coats onto him are naught but legend, in a tragic instance of ostension (the realization in actual life of elements key to a pre-existing urban folktale), one very real baby died in somewhat similar manner on 30 October 2011 when the 2-month-old son of 27-year-old Corrina Atuatasi of Garden Grove, California, suffocated in a pile of clothing in his mother's home. Atuatasi had left the baby unsupervised in her apartment to smoke a cigarette in the courtyard, then joined friends in another unit in the complex to have drinks with them. At some point she took a break from partying to fetch the child to the gathering, whom she had placed in a car seat. Somehow, after she and her young son returned home at approximately 4 a.m., the baby died face down in a pile of clothes. Atuatasi was arrested on a charge of involuntary manslaughter, with prosecutors asserting she either dropped the helpless infant onto the pile upon getting home or kicked him off the bed as she slept.",6,Baby Smothered Under Pile of Coats?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/coat-check/,legend,Tragic tale tells of a baby left on a bed who is smothered under coats carelessly dropped by Christmas guests.,Barbara Mikkelson,2007-01-02,A baby left on a bed is smothered under coats dropped by Christmas visitors.
"While at first blush the legend about a baby suffocated under a pile of guests' coats would appear to be no more than a warning for parents to never to lose track of where they've laid down an infant for its nap (via the example of a grieving family's experience demonstrating why this awareness is important), the tale espouses another meaning, one aimed not merely at parents but at everyone who celebrates Christmas.",7,Baby Smothered Under Pile of Coats?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/coat-check/,legend,Tragic tale tells of a baby left on a bed who is smothered under coats carelessly dropped by Christmas guests.,Barbara Mikkelson,2007-01-02,A baby left on a bed is smothered under coats dropped by Christmas visitors.
"The ""baby smothered under a pile of coats"" legend isn't intended as a factual account of a neglected infant's death but rather as a cautionary tale expounding upon a theme often voiced during the holiday season: that focus on the secular aspects of Christmas causes people to lose sight of the Christ child, or even to wholly forget the wee babe whose entrance into the world the festive season celebrates. The ""smothered infant"" is neglectfully left on a bed where thoughtless guests fling their coats in their rush to return to the main room and continue merrymaking, his absence from the festivity being held in his honor noticed only hours into the event, by which time he is dead. While the assembled horde remembers to party long and loud, they forget the reason why they've assembled, which is to celebrate the baptism or christening of an infant — events that, while they have their social aspects, are primarily religious. Yet the party itself eclipses its subject; in their haste to revel in the joy of the season, the thoughtless partygoers succeed with their pile of coats and casual indifference in putting the snuff on Jesus.",8,Baby Smothered Under Pile of Coats?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/coat-check/,legend,Tragic tale tells of a baby left on a bed who is smothered under coats carelessly dropped by Christmas guests.,Barbara Mikkelson,2007-01-02,A baby left on a bed is smothered under coats dropped by Christmas visitors.
"The legend is a rather gruesome communication of ""Jesus is the reason for the season.""

"Origins: In November 2006, these accounts describing a foiled child abduction at a store in Tupelo, Mississippi, began arriving in our e-mail. Akin to other Internet-circulated tales about attempted childnappings at large stores (such as the venerable canard about kids being pulled in store washrooms to be drugged and have their hair dyed by those attempting to make off with them, or the 2006 hoax about a failed child grab at a Blockbuster in North Texas), this one also proved to be a fiction.",7,Foiled Child Abduction in Tupelo Rumor,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mexican-kindergrabbing/,false,"Mexican woman attempts to abduct tot from store in Tupelo, MS?",Barbara Mikkelson,2006-12-14,"E-mail claims a Mexican woman attempted to abduct a tot from a store in Tupelo, Mississippi."
"to Lee County Sheriff Jim Johnson and Tupelo Police Chief Harold Chaffin, the story about a Mexican woman who initially admired a shopper's baby, then grabbed it from the stroller and ran off with it was pure invention. There hadn't been any such incident — no brave mom who seized the would-be abductor by her long hair and held her until police arrived, no baby-stealing illegal immigrant now behind bars awaiting trial, no ring of kidnappers frequenting Tupelo-area stores in search of product for a Mexican black market in American infants.",8,Foiled Child Abduction in Tupelo Rumor,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mexican-kindergrabbing/,false,"Mexican woman attempts to abduct tot from store in Tupelo, MS?",Barbara Mikkelson,2006-12-14,"E-mail claims a Mexican woman attempted to abduct a tot from a store in Tupelo, Mississippi."
"The Mall at Barnes Crossing, a venue where the alleged foiled abduction was said to have taken place, did succeed in tracing the e-mails to their source. Mall manager Jeff Snyder indicated no legal action was contemplated against the rumor's originator, but he noted that this could well be the last time the Mall would be inclined to be so lenient regarding damage done to its reputation.",9,Foiled Child Abduction in Tupelo Rumor,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mexican-kindergrabbing/,false,"Mexican woman attempts to abduct tot from store in Tupelo, MS?",Barbara Mikkelson,2006-12-14,"E-mail claims a Mexican woman attempted to abduct a tot from a store in Tupelo, Mississippi."
"The false story spread from inbox to inbox because it invoked not just the specter of the child-abducting stranger (a frightening enough figure all on its own) but melded into it a bogeyman of the moment, the illegal immigrant from south of the border. While illegal immigration into the U.S. from Mexico has long been a problem, prior to 2006 it was less of a concern to those not living in border states. In 2006, however, the illegal immigration issue was pushed to the center of the political arena, with some of that pushing taking the form of unsubstantiated rumors positioning all those who come into the U.S. on the sly as violent criminals. The fictive Mexican woman of this tale is presented as a kidnapper of small children, and not even one propelled by misguided maternal desire into taking youngsters so she could become their mother, but one motivated purely by avarice, in it for the cash that selling the purloined tots would bring. She is wholly and irredeemably evil and therefore held up as an example of the sort of person a ""look the other way"" attitude towards illegal immigration has allowed into the country. Her theft is not merely that of social services, it is of defenseless children; the cost of having her here is not merely a small increase in taxes paid by the typical family, but the risk that the next tot she or her compatriots snatch will be yours.",10,Foiled Child Abduction in Tupelo Rumor,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mexican-kindergrabbing/,false,"Mexican woman attempts to abduct tot from store in Tupelo, MS?",Barbara Mikkelson,2006-12-14,"E-mail claims a Mexican woman attempted to abduct a tot from a store in Tupelo, Mississippi."

"In 1984 a similar rumor mesmerized the young people of that day. According to the scuttlebutt back then, 12-year-old Alfonso Ribeiro of the Broadway show ""The Tap Dance Kid"" died in a Michael Jackson video when one of his many breakdancing moves snapped his neck. Although the false story's spread was somewhat slowed by the youngster's continued good health (as evidenced by his appearance on Donahue and a People article on him in July of that year), breathless ""Did you hear about the kid who died in the Michael Jackson video?"" whispers continued to circulate. Failing to heed the news of his own death, Ribeiro later that year advanced his career by becoming an actor in the television sitcom Silver Spoons.

"Grisly deaths of children is a recurring element in contemporary lore. Lurid fictions about the gruesome demises of kids are used to teach youngsters about the perils believed to be inherent to certain activities and so direct them away from taking such risks (e.g., through a cautionary tale about a little girl beheaded by a road sign, children are taught to keep their various body parts inside the school bus). Children who have achieved a measure of celebrity are sometimes invoked for this purpose (e.g., ""Little Mikey"" of the LIFE cereal commercials who supposedly expired from ingesting a combination of soda and Pop Rocks, ""Buffy"" of Family Affair who purportedly died à la Isadora Duncan through her scarf getting caught up in the wheels of a school bus). Tales about talented dancers who kick the bucket through engaging in the wild contortions of particular dance moves is part of that; though false, such stories work to discourage those who might otherwise be tempted to mimic gyrations that others (particularly parents) deem fraught with peril. They also serve as expressions of teen anxiety, in that the moves so flawlessly executed in the video look dangerous even to the young people yearning to try them.",4,Last Dance,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/last-dance/,false,Kid dies doing the latest dance step in a video,Barbara Mikkelson,2006-05-30,Kid dies doing the latest dance step in a video.

"While marshmallows can be quickly melted into a thick liquid, goopy substance in a pot on the stove (as anyone who has made Rice Krispies squares will attest), the temperature inside the human mouth is not sufficient to reduce them to that state. Absent chewing or licking, a marshmallow can be held in one's mouth approximately 15 minutes before it entirely disappears, its bulk gradually dissolving and being swallowed across the span of that quarter hour.

"The danger presented by the game comes not from the marshmallows being rendered into a suffocating goo in the human mouth by the heat of that environment, but from their bulk. In the zeal to best others, a child may stuff more of the confections into his mouth than he can cope with, potentially lodging one in his throat where it will block his windpipe the way a cork would.

"1. Based on a bet by the other members of his threesome, Everitt Sanchez tried to wash his own ""balls"" in a ball washer at the local golf course. Proving once again that beer and testosterone are a bad mix, Sanchez managed to straddle the ball washer and dangle his scrotum in the machine. Much to his dismay, one of his buddies upped the ante by spinning the crank on the machine with Sanchez's scrotum in place, thus wedging them solidly in the mechanism. Sanchez, who immediately passed his threshold of pain, collapsed and tumbled from his perch. Unfortunately for Sanchez, the height of the ball washer was more than a foot higher off the ground than his testicles are in a normal stance, and the scrotum was the weakest link. Sanchez's scrotum was ripped open during the fall, and one testicle was plucked from him
forever and remained in the ball washer, while the other testicle was compressed and flattened as it was pulled between the housing of the washer, and the rotating machinery inside. To add insult to injury, Sanchez broke a new $300 driver that he had just purchased from the pro shop, and was using to balance himself. Sanchez was rushed to the hospital for surgery, and the remaining three some were asked to leave the course. This last one wouldn't normally count, because the idiot didn't die.

"Scary films are a dime a dozen, but what initially drew the public's interest to the original version of The Amityville Horror was the claim that it was based on real events. The producers of the 2005 remake were also intrigued by the Amityville case not so much due to the horror film's scary details, but because the tale was allegedly true.

"The history of The Amityville Horror, as with The Exorcist, began with a best-selling novel. A book entitled The Amityville Horror: A True Story, written by Jay Anson, was published in 1977 and quickly scaled the sales charts.

"The story behind the story began on 13 November 1974, when six members of an Amityville, New York, family were killed. The parents, Ronald and Louise DeFeo, were shot in bed while they slept, along with their two sons and two daughters. The sole remaining family member, Ronald Jr. (""Butch""), was arrested for the crime, convicted, and sentenced to prison. With the family dead (and Butch in no position to inherit the place), the house went up for sale.

"The following year, a new family, the Lutzes, moved into the house. George and Kathy Lutz, along with their three children, said that shortly after they moved in, their six-bedroom abode became a Hell house. It seemed that perhaps the demons that drove Butch to slaughter his family were not in his head but in the house. An unseen force ripped doors from hinges and slammed cabinets closed, noxious green slime oozed from the ceilings, a biblical-scale swarm of insects attacked the family, and a demonic face with glowing red eyes peered into their house at night, leaving cloven-hoofed footprints in the morning snow. A priest called upon to bless the house was driven back with painful blisters on his hands, famously told by a demonic voice to ""Get out!"" And so on.",5,Was 'Amityville Horror' Based on a True Story?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-amityville-horror/,false,"""I remember going by that house and how scary it was.""",Snopes Staff,2005-04-15,'The Amityville Horror' is based on a true story.
"A local television crew did a segment on the house, bringing in several self-styled ""ghost hunters"" (including Ed and Lorraine Warren) and other alleged psychics. All agreed that a demonic spirit was in the house, and that an exorcism would be needed to stop the activity. The Lutzes left the house and took their terrifying tale with them, collaborating with Anson on the book The Amityville Horror. And, as William Peter Blatty did when he promoted The Exorcist, Anson vouched for the truthfulness of his fantastic tale: ""There is simply too much independent corroboration of their narrative to support the speculation that [the Lutzes] either imagined or fabricated these events.""",6,Was 'Amityville Horror' Based on a True Story?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-amityville-horror/,false,"""I remember going by that house and how scary it was.""",Snopes Staff,2005-04-15,'The Amityville Horror' is based on a true story.
"Many people expressed doubts about the events in the house. Researcher Rick Moran, for example, compiled a list of more than a hundred factual errors and discrepancies between Anson's ""true story"" and the truth. The 2005 remake promises to mine Anson's book more deeply than did the previous screenplays, including background about early Indians (whose vengeful spirits may lurk nearby) and devil-worshipping early settlers of the area. Yet, Moran explains, ""Experts told me that the tribe mentioned was not from the Amityville area at all (actually, they had inhabited the eastern tip of Long Island, 70 miles away) and that the settlers mentioned were never local residents either. Anson's tactic was clear — when strapped for good material for a book, pad it with quasi-factoids."" And Father Pecoraro, the priest who was driven from the house by demons?

"The truth behind The Amityville Horror was finally revealed when Butch DeFeo's lawyer, William Weber, admitted that he, along with the Lutzes, ""created this horror story over many bottles of wine."" The house was never really haunted; the horrific experiences they had claimed were simply made up. Jay Anson further embellished the tale for his book, and by the time the film's screenwriters had adapted it, any grains of truth that might have been there were long gone. While the Lutzes profited handsomely from their story, Weber had planned to use the haunting to gain a new trial for his client. George Lutz reportedly still claims that the events are mostly true, but has offered no evidence to back up his claim.",9,Was 'Amityville Horror' Based on a True Story?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-amityville-horror/,false,"""I remember going by that house and how scary it was.""",Snopes Staff,2005-04-15,'The Amityville Horror' is based on a true story.
"The Lutzes' account was likely influenced by another fictionalized story, that of The Exorcist. In fact, it is not much of a stretch to suggest that The Exorcist strongly influenced The Amityville Story: Recall that The Exorcist came out in December 1973, and demonic possession and hauntings were very much in the public's mind when the Lutzes spun their stories of diabolic activity a year or two later. The revelation that the story was based on a hoax has led to embarrassment, especially among the handful of ""paranormal experts"" who ""verified"" the fictional tale. The Lutzes must have had a good laugh at the expense of the mystery-mongering ghost hunters and self-proclaimed psychics who reported their terrifying visions and verified the house's (non-existent) demonic residents.",10,Was 'Amityville Horror' Based on a True Story?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-amityville-horror/,false,"""I remember going by that house and how scary it was.""",Snopes Staff,2005-04-15,'The Amityville Horror' is based on a true story.
"To this day, the fact that The Amityville Horror story was an admitted hoax is still not widely known — as we often say, the truth never stands in the way of a good story. Though the story was made up by the Lutzes and further sensationalized by Anson, there were real victims of The Amityville Horror (the film, not the demons). In addition to the murdered DeFeo family, the subsequent occupants of the Amityville home have suffered a continual stream of harassment by curiosity seekers, horror fans, and gawkers who want to photograph and tour their infamous house.

"The lollipops reported on by the DEA were the maple leaf and Santa head of the e-mailed caution. According to that agency, each of these bonbons weighed approximately 10 grams and were green, red, or amber in color. One cache of the candies had been confiscated by the Chicago Police in early January 2004 and another in March. These THC- and PCP-enhanced sweets known as ""dro pops"" were being sold in that city for $10 to $30 each. There were no reports of any unsuspecting parties having been made ill by the disguised drugs, let alone of any children harmed by them. (THC is the main substance in marijuana.

"We noted earlier the Memphis Police Department denied having found such lollipops. Yet there is a Memphis connection with this rumor, because in March 2004 Captain Bill Rasco with the DeSoto County Sheriff's Department said of the corrupted sweets, ""These are going around the schools now. These things are dangerous."" Rasco was commenting on the finds in Chicago (none of the suckers had turned up in DeSoto schools), but his remarks appeared in the Commercial Appeal, the major newspaper in Memphis, Tennessee. That article also contained something very much in line with the e-mail's ""Officials' fears that these suckers will begin to show up throughout the state"" — it said of the pops, ""The department believes they may be here in the next few days or weeks"" (which, as it turned out, was not the case).",11,Are Drug-Laced Suckers Being Handed Out to Children?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/suckered/,mixture,It appears a valid report about drugs confiscated by the police fell into the hands of someone with an active imagination.,Barbara Mikkelson,2004-10-19,Drug-laced suckers are being handed out to children in Arkansas.

"As to why anyone would think to fashion drugs into the form of suckers for any intent other than tricking youngsters into getting high and possibly hooked, we can quickly think of three valid reasons, none of which have anything to do with luring children down the primrose path to their destruction. First, those looking to import illegal substances have a better likelihood of success if their wares can pass for something other than contraband. By concealing the drugs inside candy shells (as was the case with the LaGuardia haul), there is a far greater possibility of getting them past Customs and DEA personnel. In such instances, the lollipops are no more than temporary containers meant to be smashed open and discarded once they've served their purpose of hoodwinking those attempting to safeguard the borders.",13,Are Drug-Laced Suckers Being Handed Out to Children?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/suckered/,mixture,It appears a valid report about drugs confiscated by the police fell into the hands of someone with an active imagination.,Barbara Mikkelson,2004-10-19,Drug-laced suckers are being handed out to children in Arkansas.
"Second, a great many drug users are young adults who delight in fanciful shapes and markings on their drugs, possibly in appreciation of the whimsy of it all. Ecstasy tablets stamped with the likenesses of cartoon characters are routinely turned up by law enforcement. Though less common now, in the 1970s blotter sheets of LSD were also printed with cartoon characters (a circumstance that sparked a long-lived rumor about children tricked into applying drug-saturated rub-on ""tattoos"" to themselves). The THC and PCP Santas and maple leaves would market well among such a clientele, a fact that would not be lost on those who make it their business to vend illegal feel-goods.",14,Are Drug-Laced Suckers Being Handed Out to Children?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/suckered/,mixture,It appears a valid report about drugs confiscated by the police fell into the hands of someone with an active imagination.,Barbara Mikkelson,2004-10-19,Drug-laced suckers are being handed out to children in Arkansas.
"Third, having the ability to ingest illegal pharmaceuticals in a surreptitious manner would hold great appeal to many who use recreational drugs. Those drawn to the drug culture find at least some of its allure lies in the sense of using being a forbidden activity; by indulging in illegal substances and by so doing breaking one of Society's taboos, they come to view themselves as living daring, exciting lives in which the normal rules do not apply. For such, the ability to suck on a candy that was getting them high while having a conversation with the boss or a parent would be almost beyond price. The sense of having gotten away with something would add that little extra spice to the experience, further underscoring their self-concept of being counter-culture darlings.",15,Are Drug-Laced Suckers Being Handed Out to Children?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/suckered/,mixture,It appears a valid report about drugs confiscated by the police fell into the hands of someone with an active imagination.,Barbara Mikkelson,2004-10-19,Drug-laced suckers are being handed out to children in Arkansas.
"So, are there drug-infused lollipops? Yes, there have been, but the last ones were seen in Chicago in March 2004. Have youngsters innocent of any desire to get high been plied with these suckers by the ill-intentioned? There are no reports of this, not so much as one recorded instance. Given the span of time since these pops last surfaced and the lack of child-related incidents, we think this warning hardly the stuff of ""If you have children, or know someone with children, PLEASE inform them of this possible threat to our children.""",16,Are Drug-Laced Suckers Being Handed Out to Children?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/suckered/,mixture,It appears a valid report about drugs confiscated by the police fell into the hands of someone with an active imagination.,Barbara Mikkelson,2004-10-19,Drug-laced suckers are being handed out to children in Arkansas.

"After she wrote down the number, the babysitter asked if she could watch satellite TV in their bedroom. She had just put the children to bed and wanted to watch a particular show. (The parents didn't want their children watching too much garbage, so the living room TV did not have satellite channels.)",2,Home Intruder Poses as Clown Statue,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/statue-of-limitations-2/,legend,Remember this tale about a babysitter who makes an unfortunate discovery?,Barbara Mikkelson,2004-10-10,A clown statue that spooked a babysitter turns out to be a knife-wielding intruder hiding in the house.
"In the stories that feature the clown having been found in the parents' bedroom, the slant of the tale leads readers to assume it is the babysitter, not her charges, that are the predator's primary focus. (The tot-tending teen having been selected as the killer's (next) victim is a key element in another urban legend: the classic ""Babysitter and the Man Upstairs,"" in which the sitter receives a series of disturbing phone calls entreating her to check on the sleeping children and so put herself in the room with the murderer.) Yet in the tellings where the clown statue has been found in the children's room, the object of harm is the youngsters, not the young lady watching over them. Some renditions make the pedophilic element unmistakable by having a frightened child report having been touched inappropriately by something in its room, and others only hint at it via brief closing comments about the captured man having been revealed to be a sexual predator wanted in a number of states.",3,Home Intruder Poses as Clown Statue,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/statue-of-limitations-2/,legend,Remember this tale about a babysitter who makes an unfortunate discovery?,Barbara Mikkelson,2004-10-10,A clown statue that spooked a babysitter turns out to be a knife-wielding intruder hiding in the house.
"Significantly, all the tellings we have so far encountered terminate in the bad guy not only running from the house but being captured by the police and so brought to justice. Could this indicate a subtle shift in how safe we as a society feel about our world, in that it now strikes us as right that a scary story complete with the villain giving up his evil plans and running away when confronted with discovery yet even so not being able to elude retribution?",4,Home Intruder Poses as Clown Statue,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/statue-of-limitations-2/,legend,Remember this tale about a babysitter who makes an unfortunate discovery?,Barbara Mikkelson,2004-10-10,A clown statue that spooked a babysitter turns out to be a knife-wielding intruder hiding in the house.
"Needless to say, homicidal maniacs and pedophiles have not commonly taken to donning clown costumes and passing themselves off as items of home decor. (Although one famous serial killer, <a href=""https://www.carpenoctem.tv/serial-killers/john-wayne-gacy/"" target=""gacy"" rel=""noopener"">John Wayne Gacy,did sometimes dress as a clown, it was for the purpose of entertaining children at parties and charity events; it was not how he attired himself when torturing and murdering his victims.) Yet lack of real killer clowns to the contrary, a substantial number of folks admit to a sense of disquiet about clowns, and some actually fear them. There is something about the grotesquely exaggerated makeup that inspires a sense of unease, even menace, with this perception remarkably widespread across all age groups. (In St. Louis, a strip mall named the General Grant Center has come to be known as ""Scary Clown Plaza"" thanks to a 15-foot clown statue erected there. As the local paper said, ""We can't put our finger on what accounts for the sinister aura that seems to surround this supposedly jovial fellow, but too many folks from diverse backgrounds have commented on it to just be coincidence."")",5,Home Intruder Poses as Clown Statue,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/statue-of-limitations-2/,legend,Remember this tale about a babysitter who makes an unfortunate discovery?,Barbara Mikkelson,2004-10-10,A clown statue that spooked a babysitter turns out to be a knife-wielding intruder hiding in the house.
"Before we entirely dismiss the ""killer clown statue"" as naught but folklore, it should be noted that there has been at least one verifiable case of such a figure attacking someone. In 1992, in Noblesville, Indiana, a Ronald McDonald clown statue toppled onto a six-year-old girl, severing the fleshy part of her fingertip. The excised piece was reattached, but the child still had a malformed fingernail.

The victim's being positioned in the mind of the audience as the sort of fellow one would have no love for is far from accidental — his unsympathetic portrayal renders those regaled with the tale free to focus on the blood-chilling manner of the death absent the distraction of pity for the man who died.

"Even talking on the telephone during a storm is not absolutely safe. On average one person is killed by lightning while talking on the phone each year. Standard telephones (what are coming to be called land lines, meaning handsets that are plugged into outlets within the home or office) can be somewhat of a risky proposition during an electrical storm, as the wires through which telecommunications takes place can be hit by lightning, with the resultant electrical discharge instantly zapped through nearby handsets and data ports. Yet this danger is small and the number of such strikes relatively low. Even so, as thunderstorms approach, some people opt to unplug costly electrical appliances from power outlets (lightning strikes to power lines can send catastrophic discharge into one's TV) as well as uncouple phone lines from computers and modems.

"Not enough information was given in the (real) cases cited above to know whether laughter was a coincidental, contributory, or causal element of the deaths, but linguistically we've been tossing about ""dying laughing"" expressions for centuries; the Oxford English Dictionary records a use of this phrase as far back as 1596 (""Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing""). We also employ similar phrases to indicate intense feelings of humiliation (""I almost died of embarrassment""), and in a more generic sense we use 'dying' to indicate great longing (""I'm just dying to see you"") or excellence (""It's to die for"").

"Yet even if there may have been an occasional death from guffawing, it's still possible merriment is far more healthy than harmful (at least for the ones who survive). Some studies assert laughing produces beneficial effects on physical health, including decreasing the secretion of serum cortisol (a stress hormone) and boosting the blood levels of immunoglobulin A, an antibody that fights bacterial and viral infections in the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. However, not everyone in the scientific community has jumped on this bandwagon: in a study reported upon in 2002 in Current Directions in Psychological Science (""Is Laughter the Best Medicine?

"relatively well contained in modern times, but in centuries past it took many lives, with its worst ravages noted among sailors whose long sea voyages kept them from having access to fruits and vegetables.

In 1747 lemons and oranges were fed to scurvy-riddled sailors with dramatic results, and in 1795 the British navy began doling out regular rations of lime juice during long sea forays (hence the slang term 'limeys' for British sailors), a practice that was highly successful in preventing the disease.",1,College Scurvy,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sole-food/,legend,Did a college student who restricted himself to only one foodstuff contract scurvy?,Barbara Mikkelson,2003-11-12,College student who restricts himself to only one foodstuff contracts scurvy.

"Scurvy is an illness that, though it belongs to another time, is still very much with us today even in affluent countries. It is more usually found among the elderly (who may be forgetting to eat right or whose fixed incomes restrict them to a limited diet) and alcoholics (who both forget to take care of mundane bodily needs like eating in their pursuit of demon rum and whose every cent goes towards liquor purchases). But it is also on the rise among the poor of well-off societies. The impoverished often stick to bad, unvaried diets deficient in vitamins, choosing convenience and ease of preparation over good food value. (It is possible to eat well on very little money, but doing so involves cooking dishes from scratch rather than from a mix or out of a box, a practice that is far more labor intensive and skill dependent.)",9,College Scurvy,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sole-food/,legend,Did a college student who restricted himself to only one foodstuff contract scurvy?,Barbara Mikkelson,2003-11-12,College student who restricts himself to only one foodstuff contracts scurvy.

"Does this mean legions of college students are dragging their scurvy-riddled bodies to class each day? Oh, probably not. Though malnutrition and even vitamin C deficiency might be occurring often enough to be noted on campus, it takes a person twenty to forty days without vitamin C to develop scurvy. Remember, even very small amounts of ascorbic acid prevent this disease, and as well as the obvious citrus fruit sources (oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruits), this key vitamin is found in a number of other fruits and vegetables such as strawberries, cantaloupes, papayas, raspberries, kiwi fruits, tomatoes, watermelons, green peppers, cabbage, cauliflower, spinach, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and potatoes. A serving of any one of these will generally provide the recommended minimum dietary allowance (RDA) of 60 mg a day of vitamin C for an adult, but as little as a daily dose of 5-7 mg will prevent scurvy. Therefore, even a mere tomato slice a day should be enough to fend off this ailment or, for those really pinching the pennies, a quarter of a cup of cooked potatoes.",11,College Scurvy,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sole-food/,legend,Did a college student who restricted himself to only one foodstuff contract scurvy?,Barbara Mikkelson,2003-11-12,College student who restricts himself to only one foodstuff contracts scurvy.

When The Texas Chain Saw Massacre hit movie theaters in 1974, it quickly supplanted the previous year's top horror flick, The Exorcist, as ""the most terrifying movie ever made."" Unlike The Exorcist, however, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre eschewed standard production values and modern special effects in favor of a grainy documentary-like approach with decidedly low-tech visual effects. The tale of five young students who unwittingly meet up with a sinister hitchhiker and the mask-wearing maniac Leatherface (whose mask is actually made from dried human skin, not leather), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre turned ""a lumberjack's tool into the stuff of nightmares and the blood-curdling scream into an art form,"" in the words of Toronto Star writer Melissa Aronzyk.",1,Was 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' Based on a True Story?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/texas-chainsaw-massacre/,mostly false,"A remake of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' was promoted with the tagline, ""Inspired by a true story,"" prompting fans to wonder about the origin of this horror classic.",David Mikkelson,2003-10-15,The film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was based on a true story.

So when they set out to write this movie, they decided to have a family of killers who had some of the characteristics of Gein: the skin masks, the furniture made from bones, the possibility of cannibalism. But that's all. The story itself is entirely made up. So, sorry folks. There never was a massacre in Texas on which this was based. No chainsaw either. And, in spite of those of you who have told me you remember when it happened, it really didn't happen. Really. Believe me. This is an interesting phenomenon. I've also had people tell me that they knew the original Leatherface, that they had been guards at the state prison in Huntsville, Texas, where he was a prisoner.

"Police eventually discovered the remains of 15 different mutilated female bodies in Gein's filthy farmhouse, parts of which (mostly skin and bones) had been fashioned into a variety of bizarre objects (including drums, bowls, masks, bracelets, purses, knife sheaths, leggings, chairs, lampshades, and shirts), as well as a refrigerator full of human organs.",8,Was 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' Based on a True Story?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/texas-chainsaw-massacre/,mostly false,"A remake of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' was promoted with the tagline, ""Inspired by a true story,"" prompting fans to wonder about the origin of this horror classic.",David Mikkelson,2003-10-15,The film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was based on a true story.
"Gein later admitted to killing two women, one in 1954 and one in 1957. He was suspected of involvement in the disappearance of four other people in central Wisconsin (two men and two young girls) between 1947 and 1952, but the remains found in his farmhouse all came from adult females, and none of them matched up with any of the four missing persons. (Gein maintained that with the exception of the two women he had admitted killing, all of the body parts in his farmhouse had been taken from corpses he dug up in the local cemetery.)",9,Was 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' Based on a True Story?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/texas-chainsaw-massacre/,mostly false,"A remake of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' was promoted with the tagline, ""Inspired by a true story,"" prompting fans to wonder about the origin of this horror classic.",David Mikkelson,2003-10-15,The film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was based on a true story.

Although the Leatherface character and the events depicted in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre differ in many substantial ways from what is known about the life and activities of Ed Gein (most notably in that Gein was apparently far more a grave robber than a murderer, and he didn't go around slicing up live victims with a chainsaw), there are definite similarities between the film and the Ed Gein story as well (e.g., hanging a murder victim's corpse in the house, making functional use of the skin from dead bodies, elements of cannibalism).

"Here is a safety related tid bit that I discovered because of my dog. This could be useful for those of us and our families outside. On Monday night my dog sniffed at a rather large bug (about 3 inches long) that was on our garage wall and immediately reeled back. I checked her over and saw nothing wrong — she was just pawing at her nose a little then seemed normal. Tuesday morning when I woke up she had an eye swollen shut. I irrigated it with saline and took her to the vet — she had a chemical burn on her cornea. She is getting treatment and making good progress to, hopefully, complete recovery. I photographed the bug and sent pictures to Texas A & M Entomology department — the bug is Anisomorpha monstrosa, a breed of walking stick insect imported from Belize and becoming common on the Gulf coast. This is not the normal walking stick most people are familiar with (if you are familiar with them). The female is from two to four inches long and heavy bodied. It ranges from weathered gray to shiny black in color with a distinctive pattern on its back in yellow or dull orange. This insect has a pair of meta-thoracic defense glands which can spray an irritating secretion towards ""attacking"" objects. Temporary blindness has been recorded when the secretion contacts eyes. If washed out promptly with sterile saline this poses no real hazard. If not promptly removed a chemical burn of the cornea can occur.",1,Walking Stick,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/walking-stick/,undetermined,Texas dog has unfortunate encounter with a walkingstick from Belize?,David Mikkelson,2003-09-11,Texas dog has unfortunate encounter with a walkingstick from Belize.

"As with most bugs that do not pose an immediate threat, the best advice is generally to just leave them alone — if you don't bother them, they won't bother you. Pets are another matter, of course, because they aren't so easily taught what to avoid. Just about any pet allowed to roam outside freely will encounter a variety of bugs (e.g., bees, wasps, ants, spiders) that could potentially cause them discomfort or injury through biting, stinging, or other defensive means, and even the most dedicated of pet owners can't kill off every bug that might harm their animals. About the best pet owners can do is to hope their pets learn through experience which bugs to leave alone, and try to be alert to the first signs of discomfort in their pets so that any serious bites or stings are treated as quickly as possible.",7,Walking Stick,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/walking-stick/,undetermined,Texas dog has unfortunate encounter with a walkingstick from Belize?,David Mikkelson,2003-09-11,Texas dog has unfortunate encounter with a walkingstick from Belize.

"Origins: Although we dread the gory industrial accidents that leave their victims dead or result in the loss of a limb (or more), other types of on-the-job injuries can strike us as far more horrific.

"Hunt was working in the Tahoe Donner Subdivision in Truckee, standing atop a six-foot ladder while drilling over his head, when he gave the drill an extra push to bore a hole. As he felt the ladder begin to wobble out from under him, he tried tossing his power drill aside (a standard practice in the construction industry, intended to prevent workers from injuring themselves attempting to regain grips on out-of-control power tools) before falling to the ground. Unfortunately, he wasn't able to throw the drill far enough away, and he landed upon it face-first. The 18-inch-long, 1.5-inch diameter chip auger drill bit pierced Hunt's right eye and exited through the side of his skull.

"By the time I was falling, and I let the drill go down, I was already on top of it. The drill was facing up but it was off. When the drill hit, it just exploded my eye. It skewered me. I ran my hands up the drill bit, up to my eye, and put my other hand in the back of my head and felt it coming through the back of my head, and that's where pretty much the shock set in. The first thing I thought was 'Am I going to die?' I knew it was serious. I was scared.

"300 yards to a nearby house to summon medical help, and when paramedics arrived they released the body of the drill from the bit and loaded Hunt onto a gurney. Hunt (conscious throughout his ordeal) was then flown by helicopter to Washoe Medical Center in Reno, Nevada, where doctors pondered their options for treating the bizarre injury. Miraculously, although the drill bit tunneled between Hunt's scalp and his skull as it came out of the side of his head, it pushed his brain aside rather than pushing into it, sparing him from death, brain damage, or paralysis.",4,Drill Bit Accident,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bit-of-trouble/,true,Did a man survive an accident that poked an drill bit through one eye and out the side of his skull?,David Mikkelson,2003-09-05,A construction worker survived an accident that poked an 18-inch-long drill bit through one eye and out the side of his skull.
"We had to either cut down on it, which meant making a rather long incision through a lot of muscle, or just unscrew it - twist it all the way through and out.

Although he was truly fortunate not to have suffered more severe injuries (or damage to his motor or speech skills), he came away from the accident far from unscathed: besides suffering a fractured skull (which required a second operation to insert two titanium plates to reinforce the fractured bone), he lost an eye and now faces hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills and rehabilitation costs.

"Origins: John Howard Griffin was born in Dallas, Texas, in 1920 but left the United States for France at age fifteen in pursuit of a classical education.

"The outbreak of World War II intruded upon Griffin's plans; he responded to the challenge by calling upon his medical training to serve as a medic in France before spending three years with the U.S. Army Air Corps in the South Seas (where he was decorated for bravery). During Griffin's military service a head injury caused by an exploding shell caused his eyesight to deteriorate to the point that he eventually went completely blind.

"Griffin's account of his experiences, published as the book Black Like Me in 1961, is a gripping tale of degradation and cruelty, an account of a man who becomes the target of rudeness, indignities, insults, racial slurs, and violent threats, and is denied the basic necessities of life (a place to live, gainful employment, transportation, even the use of restrooms) simply because his skin is dark. Particularly revealing experiences came at the end of Griffin's investigation when he switched back and forth between his black and white identities and observed the negative reactions he received from people (both black and white) who had treated him kindly just days, or even hours, earlier:",5,Death of John Howard Griffin,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dead-like-me/,false,Did the author of 'Black Like Me' die from skin cancer caused by the treatment he underwent to darken his skin?,David Mikkelson,2003-07-27,"John Howard Griffin, the author of Black Like Me, died from skin cancer caused by the treatment he underwent to darken his skin."
"Black Like Me disabused the idea that minorities were acting out of paranoia,” says Gerald Early, a black scholar at Washington University. “There was this idea that black people said certain things about racism, and one rather expected them to say these things. Griffin revealed that what they were saying was true. It took someone from outside coming in to do that.

"Under the direction of a New Orleans dermatologist, Griffin had taken medication orally and had exposed his entire body to the ultraviolet rays of a sun lamp. For about a week, up to fifteen hours each day, he had stretched out on a couch under the glare of the lamp. His eyes had been protected by cotton pads when he faced the lamp, and he had worn sunglasses when turned away from its rays. The doctor had prescribed Oxsoralen — a drug used to treat vitiligo, a cutaneous infection most common among but not exclusive to black people, which produces white splotches on the skin. Typically the medication is given over a period of six to twelve weeks. However, Griffin's experiment necessitated an accelerated pace. By taking larger than normal doses of the drug along with extended exposure under the lamp, the slow darkening process was intensified. Despite the serious health hazards, the doctor agreed to the acceleration but monitored the experiment with regular blood tests that charted any damage to the liver.

"Live ""dung"" beetles today emerged out of a perforation in the lower part of the body of a two-and-half-year-old boy in a rare condition known to be occurring in tropical countries. Experts termed the disease a rare case of ""scarabiasis or canthariasis"", prevalent among children between two and five years. Sources said the boy, a resident of Hakimpara, was being treated by paediatrician S.B. Mantry for lack of appetite, abdominal cramps and weakness. Last week, the boy's parents had showed Mantry a black insect which, according to them, had come out while he was defecating. They told the doctor such insects had buzzed out earlier, only this time they caught it before it could take wings. Mantry was reportedly taken aback when he was shown the beetle-like insect, which had bright yellow stripes on its black body. The doctor advised the boy's parents to have the specimen examined by Supada Mallick, a local pathologist. A surprised Mallick referred the case to another pathologist, S.K. Roy, last Saturday. Roy described the disease as scarabiasis, better known as the ""beetle disease."" He confirmed that the insect that had come out of the child’s body was a beetle.

"Although no real deaths have yet occurred, enough scary incidents have been attributed to cell phones that at least some hospitals have banned the use of those devices on their premises, or at least in their trauma, critical care, and surgical areas. Cell phone interference has supposedly created false alarms in infant incubators, prompted heart monitors to spew false results (making it appear as if patients hooked up to them were in cardiac arrest), set off fire alarms, caused IV pumps to stop working, and contributed to failures in equipment necessary for the maintenance of life itself.

The teenage girl took advantage of this time slot and decided to experiment with rubbing herself with various objects, and one of them was a broom. Finding she could not ""do much"" with the broom in her bed, she moved into the kitchen and situated herself on top of the refrigerator. Apparently her mother surprised her by opening the bathroom door before the hour was up, and the girl, not wanting her mother to find her in this compromising position, hurriedly hopped off of the refrigerator, without removing the broom handle.

"concerned with the pernicious influence of television on children could hardly find more innocuous children's TV fare these days than the Nickelodeon cartoon SpongeBob SquarePants, the animated adventures of a bright yellow sea sponge who dwells in a pineapple within the subterranean city of Bikini Bottom, works as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab, and pals around with his starfish friend, Patrick — usually to the general annoyance of Bob's cranky neighbor, Squidward. SpongeBob SquarePants is the top-rated show on broadcast or cable among youngsters 2 to 11 (even though an estimated 22% of its audience is 18 or older), the program is light-hearted and funny, the main character ""has an unending bounty of innocence and old-fashioned ethics,"" and the themes employed could satisfy even the most TV-cautious parents.

"So why did rumors of the drowning of a SpongeBob SquarePants-obsessed child begin to circulate in September of 2002, even though no such tragedy occurred? (The rumor didn't spring from a cancellation of the series; SpongeBob is slated to make his feature film debut in 2004, and Nickelodeon has stockpiled a cache of unaired episodes to dole out until then.) Parents have long been cautious, even fearful, of challenges to their authority and influence over their children, and most anything — particularly the new, unfamiliar, and faddish — that seems to occupy an inordinate amount of their children's time and attention is generally viewed with skepticism and suspicion. Television was a locus of these fears in the mid-1950s:",3,SpongeBob SquarePants Death,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/drown-by-the-sea/,false,Did a child drown after jumping into ocean to see SpongeBob SquarePants?,David Mikkelson,2003-01-03,A child drowned after jumping into the ocean to see SpongeBob SquarePants.
"From mid-decade on, the baleful effects of television on American life became a national obsession. Polls, surveys, and experts all agreed that something terrible was happening.

Officer Benson of The California Highway Patrol could find no apparent reason for Bidasoe's death. A drug overdose was suspected but no drugs were found on Bidasoe's person or in the car.

Her signature block became incorporated into the alert, with many taking its presence there as a sign that the information contained in the warning had been vetted by a state attorney's office and that indeed this was an official warning about a real and verified threat. It wasn't real; it was a case of a low-level employee's forwarding baseless scaremail to others.

"Unfortunately, Halloween has also been a time when some people acquire pets — particularly cats — to use as living decorations or for displays of fun and sport, only to discard or abandon them afterwards (as often happens with chicks and rabbits at Easter time).

"More than 2,000 years ago, in the area we know now as Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales, Druid priests capitalized upon such fears by nurturing the belief that evil spirits were responsible for bringing about the advent of cold weather and shorter hours of daylight.

"This ""new year's eve"" celebration gradually grew to ominous proportions. The priests ordered the people to extinguish all hearth fires and to gather around huge bonfires on hilltops.

"The notion then developed that the souls of sinful persons, as well as all other evil spirits, were at large in the community during that night. To discourage these mysterious entities from acts of retribution, sacrifices were thrown into the bonfires. At first, the sacrifices were domesticated animals.

The explicit warning presented in a common child abduction legend is obvious: You must never, ever let your child out of your sight in a public place, even for a moment — kidnappers could be lurking anywhere, and the attempted abduction in the following examples was foiled only due to the diligence of an employee and the thoroughness of a store's security precautions:",1,Child Abduction from Theme Park Thwarted by Shoes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/child-abduction-shoes/,false,"Urban legend holds that an attempted abduction of a child from a big box store, mall, or amusement park was thwarted because the kidnappers neglected to change the child's shoes.",David Mikkelson,2001-10-12,An attempted abduction of a child from a mall or amusement park was thwarted because the kidnappers forgot to change the child's shoes.
"Wanted to share something that happened today while shopping at Sam's club. A mother was leaning over looking for meat and turned around to find her 4 yr. old daughter was missing, I was standing there right beside her, well she was calling her daughter and no luck. I asked a man who worked at Sam's to announce it over the loud speaker for Katie. Well, he did, and let me say he walked past me when I asked and went to a pole where there was a phone right there to make his announcement for all doors, and gates to be locked a code something...so they locked all the doors at once. This took all of 3 min after I asked the guy to do this. They found the little girl 5 min later crunched in a bathroom stall, her head was half shaved, and she was dressed in her underwear with a bag of clothes, a razor, and wig sitting on the floor besides her. Whoever this person was, took the little girl, brought her into the bathroom, shaved half her head, undressed her in a matter of less than 10 min.

"One of my brother's works at the Sam's Club in Murfreesboro, TN and yesterday he called me with some very disturbing news. As most stores, Sam's has different codes that are stated over the intercom throughout the store such as for extra help, severe weather, etc. Sam’s has a code called ""Code Adam"" for when a child becomes missing or is feared kidnapped. The store is immediately shut down and employees are instructed to go to an entrance/exit. That code was called yesterday at his store. A mother had her four year old daughter standing next to her as she was looking in the meat department. Then she noticed she was gone and notified a manager who then notified the store manager. Immediately, the ""Code Adam"" was called and all employees went to each exit in the store not allowing anyone to enter or exit. They found the little girl in the bathroom with the predator. Her head was partially shaved, she had on a different outfit, and a wig was found. This all happened within less than five minutes.

"Although these warnings may contain some good advice, the legend they present exaggerates both the prevalence and manner of kidnappings. A child is far more likely to be snatched by a family member or ex-spouse in a custodial dispute than to be the victim of a random abduction. And rarely will kidnappers go through such elaborate procedures as the ones hinted at here -- luring a child outside where he or she can be quickly bundled into an automobile is far more effective and less risky than trying to smuggle one out the exit of a crowded public space. (Some of the examples presented above don't even make much logical sense. Why would abductors waste precious getaway time shaving a child's head — with a razor, yet — when they already had a wig on hand to disguise their victim's natural hair color and style?)",9,Child Abduction from Theme Park Thwarted by Shoes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/child-abduction-shoes/,false,"Urban legend holds that an attempted abduction of a child from a big box store, mall, or amusement park was thwarted because the kidnappers neglected to change the child's shoes.",David Mikkelson,2001-10-12,An attempted abduction of a child from a mall or amusement park was thwarted because the kidnappers forgot to change the child's shoes.
"This form of tale that has been circulating for decades, always involving the kidnapping of children from family-type public places such as amusement parks and shopping centers. In the basic form of the legend, a kidnapper snatches a child away from an inattentive parent, drugs it, and hustles it into a restroom; there the abductor performs a quick haircut, dye job, and clothing change on the child to conceal its identity (and sometimes to obscure its gender) and wraps it in blankets before attempting to quickly and quietly spirit the child off the premises. Meanwhile, a vigilant security force has sealed off all the exits, and the attempted kidnapping is thwarted either because the kidnapper realizes he cannot escape undetected and simply abandons his intended victim in the bathroom, or because the child's parent is monitoring the exits (in person or via security cameras) and recognizes the youngster by its distinctive shoes, which the kidnapper has neglected to change or remove.",10,Child Abduction from Theme Park Thwarted by Shoes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/child-abduction-shoes/,false,"Urban legend holds that an attempted abduction of a child from a big box store, mall, or amusement park was thwarted because the kidnappers neglected to change the child's shoes.",David Mikkelson,2001-10-12,An attempted abduction of a child from a mall or amusement park was thwarted because the kidnappers forgot to change the child's shoes.
"More malevolent versions of this story end not with the thwarting of the abduction attempt, but with the discovery of the child's original clothing on a restroom floor (along with other evidence of what had transpired, such as loose hair, scissors, and a bottle of hair dye). In these versions police tell the victims' parents they are powerless to recover their children (whom they warn are probably already on their way out of the country to be used as unwilling organ donors or sex slaves), and the parents are paid off to keep quiet about the abductions. Often the payoff for the parents' silence is claimed to be something absurdly small in value, such as free passes to the amusement park where the kidnapping took place, yet people continue to take the story at face value. (Would you keep quiet about your child's disappearance for any amount of money, much less something as paltry as a few free tickets?)",11,Child Abduction from Theme Park Thwarted by Shoes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/child-abduction-shoes/,false,"Urban legend holds that an attempted abduction of a child from a big box store, mall, or amusement park was thwarted because the kidnappers neglected to change the child's shoes.",David Mikkelson,2001-10-12,An attempted abduction of a child from a mall or amusement park was thwarted because the kidnappers forgot to change the child's shoes.
"The tale of the ""haircut-and-dye-job"" kidnappers goes back several decades and is tied to the growth of cities, the movement away from rural areas and small towns, and the increase in the crime rate that occurred in America after World War II. The small-town communities where everyone knew everyone else, outsiders were few, and residents felt safe leaving their doors unlocked at night began to disappear; as people increasingly became part of large, impersonal urban centers, they began to develop fears about the relative anonymity and facelessness of their day-to-day lives. Several of these fears are expressed in this one legend alone: fear of crime and mistrust of strangers (you don't know everyone here; criminals could be anywhere in the crowds you encounter every day, blending in with the masses), lack of faith in the willingness and effectiveness of police protection (the police are ""powerless"" to recover the missing children and therefore don't even try), and distrust of powerful, monolithic corporations (these companies don't care about you or your children; they'll pay you off to make sure you don't dent their enormous profits or ruin their carefully-cultivated family image by blabbing the TRUTH to the media). Even though most versions describe the kidnappers as being caught because of their carelessness, the story still serves its function of providing a vivid cautionary tale to drive home the message that you must carefully keep an eye on your children at all times while out in public: just a few moments' slip-up can lead to disaster.",12,Child Abduction from Theme Park Thwarted by Shoes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/child-abduction-shoes/,false,"Urban legend holds that an attempted abduction of a child from a big box store, mall, or amusement park was thwarted because the kidnappers neglected to change the child's shoes.",David Mikkelson,2001-10-12,An attempted abduction of a child from a mall or amusement park was thwarted because the kidnappers forgot to change the child's shoes.
"Over the years, this story has been set in virtually every type of locale where families mingle with large numbers of strangers, such as shopping malls, beaches, carnivals, fairs, and amusement parks. Since the details of urban legends tend to gravitate towards the most prominent examples of their kind, this legend has become more and more associated with theme parks such as Disneyland and Canada's Wonderland, and big-box retailers such as Walmart stores, examples of well-known large facilities frequented by families with children and parts of huge corporate enterprises. (In truth, no child has ever been kidnapped from a Disney theme park, and although the abduction and murder of 6-year-old Adam Walsh led Walmart to create its Code Adam protocol for locating missing children in their stores, Adam Walsh actually disappeared from a Sears outlet, and no evidence was found to indicate the abductor had made an effort to alter Adam's appearance.)",13,Child Abduction from Theme Park Thwarted by Shoes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/child-abduction-shoes/,false,"Urban legend holds that an attempted abduction of a child from a big box store, mall, or amusement park was thwarted because the kidnappers neglected to change the child's shoes.",David Mikkelson,2001-10-12,An attempted abduction of a child from a mall or amusement park was thwarted because the kidnappers forgot to change the child's shoes.

"All of this is by way of introduction to my theory on the origins of this legend. The plot of the 2 April 1991 episode of the TV show Law and Order (titled ""Sonata for Solo Organ"") featured the theft of a kidney. Law and Order is a story-driven hour-long drama that prides itself in taking its script ideas from real-life contemporary news. In this case, the writer said he'd heard this tale from a friend, and the friend had assured him it came from the pages of a newspaper. Yet no one could find that article.",8,Kidney Theft,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/youve-got-to-be-kidneying/,false,The legend of unwary travellers drugged and used as unwilling kidney donors by bands of organ thieves.,Barbara Mikkelson,2001-09-05,Drugged travelers awaken in ice-filled bathtubs only to discover one of their kidneys has been harvested by organ thieves.
"Kurdish Moslem Ahmet Koc, 34, said through an interpreter he had been lured to Britain last year with the promise of a job by Turkish businessmen who told him he would need a medical check.He went to a hospital which he thought was a hotel and allowed himself to be given an injection which he believed was a blood test. When he came round he was told his appendix had been taken out. It was only three days later that he was told his kidney had been removed and transplanted into another patient in the hospital but that he would be paid a lot of money for it.",9,Kidney Theft,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/youve-got-to-be-kidneying/,false,The legend of unwary travellers drugged and used as unwilling kidney donors by bands of organ thieves.,Barbara Mikkelson,2001-09-05,Drugged travelers awaken in ice-filled bathtubs only to discover one of their kidneys has been harvested by organ thieves.
"Far from being a victim, Koc was one of a willing consignment of four Turks who sold a kidney that day. The removals/transplants took place in Britain in 1988, and in January 1989 Koc went on record in Turkey with his tale of organ abduction, likely in an effort to get the organ brokers who'd handled his case into trouble with Turkish authorities. (Which he succeeded in doing — one of the two brothers who'd arranged the sale was charged in January 1989 and sentenced to two years in jail in May of that year as a result of Koc's testimony. Koc received a two-year suspended sentence for his part in the illegal sale.)",10,Kidney Theft,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/youve-got-to-be-kidneying/,false,The legend of unwary travellers drugged and used as unwilling kidney donors by bands of organ thieves.,Barbara Mikkelson,2001-09-05,Drugged travelers awaken in ice-filled bathtubs only to discover one of their kidneys has been harvested by organ thieves.
Yet it was not until December 1989 that Koc's concocted story about being an unwitting victim became all the rage in the British press for it was then he was called upon by a General Medical Council's disciplinary hearing to testify in England against the doctors involved. His testimony — which included his horrific tale about waking up dazed and confused in a hospital he thought was a hotel — was widely reported at that time.,11,Kidney Theft,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/youve-got-to-be-kidneying/,false,The legend of unwary travellers drugged and used as unwilling kidney donors by bands of organ thieves.,Barbara Mikkelson,2001-09-05,Drugged travelers awaken in ice-filled bathtubs only to discover one of their kidneys has been harvested by organ thieves.
"Justice was eventually served, and Koc's advertisement in a Turkish newspaper offering to sell one of his kidneys came to light. Even so, his story made quite the splash at the time it hit the papers.

"Mr. Koc said he was taken to the hospital by two brothers, Ata Nur and Tunc Kunter, who have been described to the hearing as kidney brokers. He said he did not see any doctors or nurses when he arrived because he was taken straight into a lift and shown to a luxurious room with a couch, television, wardrobe and bed. ""They drove me to a building which I thought was a hotel. I now know it as the Humana. I had a meal and they (the Kunters) left and I woke up in the morning."" A woman ""wearing something white like a nurse"" came in and after asking him to sign a document returned with a syringe in her hand.

"The residue of this December 1989 media splash might well have been what the Law and Order writer's friend remembered. It might also have been what kicked off the story of the unwary traveler, the one about a fella who was lured back to his hotel room and the next day woke up with one less kidney than when he'd started out. Certainly this media circus would have at least set in place the major themes of the legend: the unknowing victim, the hotel room, the waking up in confusion and pain the next day.

"As mentioned earlier, the legend has changed from its early days and now includes such up-to-date frills as instructions to call 911 and e-mail exhortations to immediately pass this warning along. It's the panic nature of scarelore that speeds it along at such a breathtaking rate — though a story about a dog and peanut butter might shock one into wondering what this world is coming to, it just doesn't bring with it the same compelling incentive to protect those you care about by getting this information to them right away.

This panic-stricken reaction takes its toll, and the 1997 New Orleans romp through cyberspace well demonstrates it.

"The best explanation we can offer as to why this bit of scarelore has gained, and kept, its popularity, has to do with the growing familiarity of the general population with organ transplants. As these procedures have become more a part of the world we live in, so has awareness of the problems associated to them. The stark reality is that there are more people in need of transplantable organs than there are organs to go around. Knowing that, it's reasonable to believe wild stories of kidneys being hijacked from the unwary. Standing in the shoes of someone desperate for this procedure, wouldn't you be willing to pay just about anything to secure what you needed to keep on living?

"Update: In 1995, India's parliament passed a bill limiting organ donations to close relatives and imposing prison terms of up to seven years for selling an organ. But in Uttar Pradesh and a string of other states where the law has not been ratified by state legislatures, middlemen continue to track poor people in need of quick money and coax them to operating tables. In such instances, these paid donors receive about $1,000, more than a year's salary for a rural Indian laborer.

"Still, news accounts from India occasionally surface reporting claims that doctors have been arrested for stealing kidneys (either through trickery or force) from unsuspecting citizens. Such claims are difficult to evaluate given the typical lack of any follow-ups in the Western press, but other sources suggest the usual result is that charges are dropped or reduced when investigations determine that the claimants entered into voluntary agreements to sell their kidneys (and later leveled criminal accusations because they regretted their decisions or were disgruntled with the size of the payments they had received).",22,Kidney Theft,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/youve-got-to-be-kidneying/,false,The legend of unwary travellers drugged and used as unwilling kidney donors by bands of organ thieves.,Barbara Mikkelson,2001-09-05,Drugged travelers awaken in ice-filled bathtubs only to discover one of their kidneys has been harvested by organ thieves.

"Recently on a neighboring railroad, two Mechanical employees were killed as a result of butane cigarette lighters exploding.

"Photocopied fliers alerting industrial workers to this ""DEADLY HAZARD"" circulated widely.

"By November 1979, Union Pacific Railroad had fielded hundreds of calls from reporters and concerned foremen about these supposed horrific accidents, and it issued a press release about the rumor. In it, Union Pacific's safety director was quoted as saying: ""It just didn't happen. Union Pacific certainly doesn't endorse butane lighters, or any other product, for that matter.

"No welders working for Pacific Railroad or any other employer had been killed by exploding lighters, nor have any been killed in the years since the rumor's appearance. Yet even though the ""welders killed by an exploding lighter"" legend isn't true, it does not necessarily follow that butane lighters are completely safe and will never explode. In the legend, all it takes is an errant spark to set them off, but the chilling reality is that even well-constructed disposable lighters can, and have, blown up when left in too warm an environment. Leaving a lighter in a sunlit car or merely walking around with one in a pocket during a heatwave can be all it takes to turn a 99¢ convenience item into an explosion. Heat-induced pressure builds up inside, eventually creating too much force to be contained by the materials used in the lighter's housing.

Usually such tales are either outright fabrications or, when the ""threats"" have something to them, nothing more than exaggerations, with the warned-against activity consummated in the gore-dripped death of a foolhardy soul who engaged in the practice being decried. In those instances, even when the danger is real, the outcome as expressed in the story is not: The lurking menace is presented as a killer in order to make a point, not because such deaths have actually occurred.",8,Exploding Lighters,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-lighter-side-of-death/,false,Can disposable cigarette lighters explode?,Barbara Mikkelson,2001-06-10,"Spark from a welding arc reaches disposable lighter in worker's pocket, causing it to explode and kill him."
"In 1985, 66-year-old Ethel L. Smith of Pennsylvania died from injuries sustained, it was asserted, when a Bic butane lighter exploded in her hands while she was using it to light her cigarette, and her estate sued Bic for $11 million. The disposition of the case is unknown. (Bic is known for resolving lawsuits against it out of court and, as part of the settlements, insisting the plaintiffs agree to refrain from discussing their cases.

"Sadly, the basic thrust of the legend — that a child was scalped by an amusement ride — is true. On 14 September 1996, 8-year-old Danielle Foti and her friend, Valentina Espinola, were celebrating their eighth birthdays with a visit to Bonkers 19 indoor amusement park at the Harborlight Mall in Weymouth, Massachusetts.

"What puts this real-life accident within the realm of lore is how the incident is now remembered. As shown by the examples quoted above, people recall it having happened at a number of different parks and having involved a high-speed, high-drop thrill ride, or at least a ride in which height played a significant factor (such as a ferris wheel). In such scenarios, the horrifying event would not only have been public, but the victim would have been hung in the air for all to see. However, the Mini Himalaya cannot by any stretch of the imagination be considered a ""thrill ride,"" as the following photograph shows.

"A 42-year-old male electrician presented to the eye clinic with decreasing vision 4 weeks after an electrical burn of 14,000 V to the left shoulder. His vision in both eyes was limited to perception of hand motions, with an intraocular pressure of 14 mm Hg in each eye. Slit-lamp examination showed bilateral stellate anterior subcapsular opacities of the lens. Dilated funduscopic examination showed scattered cotton-wool spots and bilateral optic-nerve pallor, which was greatest in the left eye. Four months after the injury, the patient underwent cataract extraction and implantation of an intraocular lens, which was followed by improvement in visual acuity to 20/70 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left eye. Two years after the injury, a retinal detachment developed in the left eye, and the patient underwent repair. At a 10-year follow-up visit, the patient's visual acuity was 20/100 in the right eye, but in the left eye he could only count fingers. There was bilateral optic atrophy with widespread macular pigment disruption. Although the patient was legally blind, he was able to read with the use of low-vision aids and was able to independently commute on public transportation. When lenticular opacities are the sole manifestations of electrical injury, cataract extraction is expected to produce a functional outcome. However, with concurrent damage to the optic nerve and retina, complete visual rehabilitation may be limited.

"Despite what one might envision from hearing the term ""ashes,"" human cremains are neither feathery little wisps akin to ash that might conceivably have blown from a campfire, nor an incredibly fine powder that could reasonably be mistaken for an illegal substance. Cremains vary in color from a gray-and-white mixture right down to a dark gray (charcoal), with unburnt trabecular bone (bone with an internal latticework) showing up yellow. If zinc had been used in the construction of the coffin, some of the cremains might appear slightly yellowed; if iron, green; if copper, pink.

"Consistency is the major factor to consider though. Unprocessed cremains are made up of bone fragments, with the resultant residue looking for all the world like used kitty litter of the gravel (not the clumping) type.

"In the U.S., cremains destined for urns are generally left unprocessed. However, if a loved one expresses a desire to scatter these mortal leavings, the question of processing might well be raised by the funeral director. Processing involves the pulverization of the gravelly residue which otherwise would contain quite recognizable fragments of bone. At one time this rendering was accomplished by passing cremains through a hand-cranked laboratory grinder. Modern crematoriums use electric processors to achieve the same end, a fine granular substance. Though this more closely resembles a drug than does gray/white gravel, once again would anyone familiar with cocaine (a powder) mistake a granulated product (something that resembles sugar) for it? We think not, but then we've never been tempted to snort dead dog.",15,Cremains Mistaken for Cocaine,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cremainlining/,legend,Thieves steal 'cocaine' which turns out to be the cremated remains of a householder's relative.,Barbara Mikkelson,2001-05-07,Thieves steal what they believe to be cocaine but what is in reality the cremated remains of the householder's relative.
"A friend of a friend worked as an airline pilot and for years flew the JFK-Heathrow run. There were many amusing incidents, but one still makes him chuckle the most. He'd flown a jumbo into London, and when all the passengers had disembarked, one of the stewardesses found a small carved box under a seat. When she opened it, she found some suspicious-looking powder inside. Customs staff specially trained to deal with drug trafficking quickly arrived and one officer opened the box, licking his finger before dipping it into the powder and putting it into his mouth to taste it.",16,Cremains Mistaken for Cocaine,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cremainlining/,legend,Thieves steal 'cocaine' which turns out to be the cremated remains of a householder's relative.,Barbara Mikkelson,2001-05-07,Thieves steal what they believe to be cocaine but what is in reality the cremated remains of the householder's relative.
"""Well, it's not a narcotic,"" he said, efficiently. Just then, an elderly lady tottered along the aisle and asked the stewardess if she'd happened to come across a small engraved casket. It apparently contained her husband's ashes.

"Nearly everyone familiar with world-famous magician and escape artist Harry Houdini, no matter how little they know about his life, knows one thing about his death: That a boastful Houdini died from trying to impress some college students with his toughness. As legend has it, Houdini was fond of explaining to his fans that by tightening his abdominal muscles he could withstand the hardest punches to the midsection a man could deliver, and one day a college student who was present when Houdini repeated his boast decided to test the claim by raining blows to the magician's midriff. The stomach punches caught Houdini by surprise before he had time to prepare himself, however, resulting in a trauma that ruptured his appendix and ultimately caused his death a few weeks later.",1,Did Houdini Die from a Punch to the Stomach?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-of-houdini/,unproven,"Nearly everyone familiar with world-famous magician and escape artist Harry Houdini, no matter how little they know about his life, knows one thing about his death.",David Mikkelson,2001-05-02,Escape artist Harry Houdini died from a ruptured appendix caused by his being punched in the stomach.
"The chain of events leading up to Houdini's final passing began in mid-October 1926, while he was undertaking a series of shows in the northeastern part of North America. Despite having broken his ankle while performing his famous Water-Torture Cell escape in Albany several days earlier, Houdini, ever the trouper, kept his engagement at the Princess Theater in Montreal and opened there on 18 October 1926. The following day Houdini delivered a lecture at McGill University about exposing fraudulent spiritualists and mediums, and afterwards he stayed around to chat with various faculty members and students. A student named Samuel J. Smilovitch approached Houdini with a sketch he'd made of the escape artist; Houdini was impressed with the drawing and invited the young man to come backstage after one of his shows and do a full portrait.",2,Did Houdini Die from a Punch to the Stomach?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-of-houdini/,unproven,"Nearly everyone familiar with world-famous magician and escape artist Harry Houdini, no matter how little they know about his life, knows one thing about his death.",David Mikkelson,2001-05-02,Escape artist Harry Houdini died from a ruptured appendix caused by his being punched in the stomach.
"Smilovitch took Houdini up on his offer, bringing along his friend Jack Price to meet the magician in the lobby of the Princess Theater the morning of Friday, 22 October. They followed Houdini to his dressing room, and a few minutes later another McGill student named Joselyn Gordon Whitehead knocked on the door. What then occurred was later described by Jack Price and included in a book by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle:",3,Did Houdini Die from a Punch to the Stomach?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-of-houdini/,unproven,"Nearly everyone familiar with world-famous magician and escape artist Harry Houdini, no matter how little they know about his life, knows one thing about his death.",David Mikkelson,2001-05-02,Escape artist Harry Houdini died from a ruptured appendix caused by his being punched in the stomach.
"Houdini was facing us and lying down on a couch at the time reading some mail, his right side nearest us. This first-year student [Whitehead] engaged Houdini more or less continually whilst my friend Mr. Smilovitch continued to sketch Houdini. This student was the first to raise the question of Houdini's strength. My friend and I were not so much interested in his strength as we were in his mental acuteness, his skill, his beliefs, and his personal experiences. Houdini stated that he had extraordinary muscles in his forearms, in his shoulders and in his back, and he asked all of us present to feel them, which we did.",4,Did Houdini Die from a Punch to the Stomach?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-of-houdini/,unproven,"Nearly everyone familiar with world-famous magician and escape artist Harry Houdini, no matter how little they know about his life, knows one thing about his death.",David Mikkelson,2001-05-02,Escape artist Harry Houdini died from a ruptured appendix caused by his being punched in the stomach.
"The first-year McGill student asked Houdini whether it was true that punches in the stomach did not hurt him. Houdini remarked rather unenthusiastically that his stomach could resist much, though he did not speak of it in superlative terms. Thereupon he gave Houdini some very hammer-like blows below the belt, first securing Houdini's permission to strike him. Houdini was reclining at the time with his right side nearest Whitehead, and the said student was more or less bending over him. These blows fell on that part of the stomach to the right of the navel, and were struck on the side nearest to us, which was in fact Houdini's right side; I do not remember exactly how many blows were struck. I am certain, however, of at least four very hard and severe body blows, because at the end of the second or third blow I verbally protested against this sudden onslaught on the part of this first-year student, using the words, ""Hey there. You must be crazy, what are you doing?"" or words to that effect, but Whitehead continued striking Houdini with all his strength.",5,Did Houdini Die from a Punch to the Stomach?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-of-houdini/,unproven,"Nearly everyone familiar with world-famous magician and escape artist Harry Houdini, no matter how little they know about his life, knows one thing about his death.",David Mikkelson,2001-05-02,Escape artist Harry Houdini died from a ruptured appendix caused by his being punched in the stomach.
"Houdini immediately after stated that he had had no opportunity to prepare himself against the blows, as he did not think that Whitehead would strike him as suddenly as he did and with such force, but that he would have been in a better position to prepare for the blows if he had risen from his couch for this purpose, but the injury to his foot prevented him from getting about rapidly.",6,Did Houdini Die from a Punch to the Stomach?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-of-houdini/,unproven,"Nearly everyone familiar with world-famous magician and escape artist Harry Houdini, no matter how little they know about his life, knows one thing about his death.",David Mikkelson,2001-05-02,Escape artist Harry Houdini died from a ruptured appendix caused by his being punched in the stomach.
"Despite Price's first-hand account, much dispute remains over exactly what took place in Houdini's dressing room that day. Houdini's wife Bess, a nurse named Sophie Rosenblatt, and Bess's niece Julia Sawyer were also present, and the details of their stories differ. Did Joselyn Whitehead really show up after Smilovitch and Price arrived, or had Smilovitch brought him along? Was Whitehead really a McGill student, or was he an amateur boxer (or both)? Was he already known to Houdini (as he presumably was if, as some rumors report, he had shown up to return some books he had borrowed from the magician). Did Whitehead really ""secure Houdini's permission"" before delivering blows to the magician's stomach, or did he mistake Houdini's casual response to his query as permission to proceed and strike before Houdini was prepared? Did Houdini even really boast that he could withstand such punches?",7,Did Houdini Die from a Punch to the Stomach?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-of-houdini/,unproven,"Nearly everyone familiar with world-famous magician and escape artist Harry Houdini, no matter how little they know about his life, knows one thing about his death.",David Mikkelson,2001-05-02,Escape artist Harry Houdini died from a ruptured appendix caused by his being punched in the stomach.
"Whatever happened, Houdini was definitely suffering from severe stomach pains by mid-afternoon, although he carried on with that evening's show and two more performances the next day. On the train to Detroit (where Houdini was scheduled to begin a two-week run of performances the following day) he was suffering mightily from the pain in his stomach, so a worried Bess telegraphed ahead and arranged for a doctor to be standing by at their hotel when they arrived. Unfortunately, their train was late, and the Houdinis thus had no time to check into their hotel and headed straight for the theatre instead.",8,Did Houdini Die from a Punch to the Stomach?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-of-houdini/,unproven,"Nearly everyone familiar with world-famous magician and escape artist Harry Houdini, no matter how little they know about his life, knows one thing about his death.",David Mikkelson,2001-05-02,Escape artist Harry Houdini died from a ruptured appendix caused by his being punched in the stomach.
"The doctor finally caught up with Houdini at the theatre, examined him in the dressing room, found him to be running a fever of 104°F, diagnosed acute appendicitis, and proclaimed that Houdini should be taken straight to a hospital by ambulance. Bess allegedly did not hear the doctor's diagnosis, and Houdini supposedly told the worried theater owner, prophetically, ""I'll do this show if it's my last.""",9,Did Houdini Die from a Punch to the Stomach?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-of-houdini/,unproven,"Nearly everyone familiar with world-famous magician and escape artist Harry Houdini, no matter how little they know about his life, knows one thing about his death.",David Mikkelson,2001-05-02,Escape artist Harry Houdini died from a ruptured appendix caused by his being punched in the stomach.
"Houdini rushed through his show and clearly was not performing well; before the third act began he finally decided that he could not carry on by himself and had his assistants finish some of his tricks for him. (Houdini did not collapse on stage, as is often reported, nor did he have to be rescued from the Water-Torture cell by an axe-wielding assistant, as portrayed in various film biographies.) Even then, Houdini would still not seek medical treatment, returning to his hotel before finally Bess ""threw a tantrum"" and summoned the hotel physician.",10,Did Houdini Die from a Punch to the Stomach?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-of-houdini/,unproven,"Nearly everyone familiar with world-famous magician and escape artist Harry Houdini, no matter how little they know about his life, knows one thing about his death.",David Mikkelson,2001-05-02,Escape artist Harry Houdini died from a ruptured appendix caused by his being punched in the stomach.
"The physician called a surgeon, who examined Houdini and told him that he must be hospitalized at once. Still, Houdini demurred, calling his personal physician, Dr. William Stone, back in New York sometime after 3:00 A.M. Only after Houdini and the other doctors had talked to Dr. Stone did Houdini finally relent and agree to be taken to Grace Hospital, where he underwent surgery to remove his appendix that afternoon (Sunday, 24 October). The surgeon who performed the operation found that Houdini's appendix had ruptured and the magician was suffering from peritonitis.",11,Did Houdini Die from a Punch to the Stomach?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-of-houdini/,unproven,"Nearly everyone familiar with world-famous magician and escape artist Harry Houdini, no matter how little they know about his life, knows one thing about his death.",David Mikkelson,2001-05-02,Escape artist Harry Houdini died from a ruptured appendix caused by his being punched in the stomach.
"The odds of surviving such an infection in the days before antibiotics were small, but Houdini gamely hung on for another four days before undergoing a second operation on Thursday, 28 October. He seemed to be recovering by the next day, but on Saturday his condition worsened, and the renowned magician escape artist passed away the next day at 52.",12,Did Houdini Die from a Punch to the Stomach?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-of-houdini/,unproven,"Nearly everyone familiar with world-famous magician and escape artist Harry Houdini, no matter how little they know about his life, knows one thing about his death.",David Mikkelson,2001-05-02,Escape artist Harry Houdini died from a ruptured appendix caused by his being punched in the stomach.
"Fittingly, the date was 31 October 1926: Halloween. The official cause of death was listed as diffuse peritonitis (i.e., an infection of the tissue lining the inner wall of the abdomen, typically resulting from an abdominal rupture), with ruptured appendicitis listed as a contributory factor.",13,Did Houdini Die from a Punch to the Stomach?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-of-houdini/,unproven,"Nearly everyone familiar with world-famous magician and escape artist Harry Houdini, no matter how little they know about his life, knows one thing about his death.",David Mikkelson,2001-05-02,Escape artist Harry Houdini died from a ruptured appendix caused by his being punched in the stomach.
"When the details of Houdini's final weeks became known in the aftermath of his passing, the common assumption took hold that the blows to the right-hand side of his abdomen (the side on which the appendix is located) Houdini had received a few weeks before his death and his ruptured appendix were directly connected: It seemed a logical conclusion at the time, even to some of his doctors, and so the Houdini death legend began. But although we will likely never know precisely what caused the magician's fatal bout of appendicitis, with the advantage of several decades of hindsight we have good reason to be skeptical about that legend.",14,Did Houdini Die from a Punch to the Stomach?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-of-houdini/,unproven,"Nearly everyone familiar with world-famous magician and escape artist Harry Houdini, no matter how little they know about his life, knows one thing about his death.",David Mikkelson,2001-05-02,Escape artist Harry Houdini died from a ruptured appendix caused by his being punched in the stomach.
"First of all, given the contradictory accounts provided by the persons who were present when Houdini was punched in his dressing room by Gordon Whitehead, it's unclear what injury the magician sustained, and how badly he was hurt (if indeed he was injured at all), by those blows.",15,Did Houdini Die from a Punch to the Stomach?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-of-houdini/,unproven,"Nearly everyone familiar with world-famous magician and escape artist Harry Houdini, no matter how little they know about his life, knows one thing about his death.",David Mikkelson,2001-05-02,Escape artist Harry Houdini died from a ruptured appendix caused by his being punched in the stomach.
"Second, reported cases in medical literature of appendicitis following blunt abdominal trauma are quite rare, and a 2010 review of such cases noted that there ""has been much debate as to whether acute appendicitis following trauma is coincidental or causal."" It's possible that the onset of Houdini's appendicitis was the result of his being punched in the stomach, but a direct connection between those two events is far less common or obvious than is widely believed.",16,Did Houdini Die from a Punch to the Stomach?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-of-houdini/,unproven,"Nearly everyone familiar with world-famous magician and escape artist Harry Houdini, no matter how little they know about his life, knows one thing about his death.",David Mikkelson,2001-05-02,Escape artist Harry Houdini died from a ruptured appendix caused by his being punched in the stomach.
"It's also possible (and perhaps much more likely) that there was a connection between the stomach blows Houdini experienced in his Montreal dressing room and his death from peritonitis a few weeks later, but in a different and more indirect fashion than is commonly assumed. Houdini may have already been suffering from the onset of appendicitis at the time Whitehead punched him and then attributed his subsequent abdominal discomfort to residual pain from those blows, causing him to delay seeking medical treatment for what otherwise would have been a routine case of appendicitis until after the organ had ruptured (producing a fatal case of peritonitis). Had the dressing room incident not occurred, Houdini might have realized the pain he was experiencing was actually a symptom of a serious medical condition and not delayed so long in consulting doctors and undergoing surgery to deal with it.",17,Did Houdini Die from a Punch to the Stomach?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-of-houdini/,unproven,"Nearly everyone familiar with world-famous magician and escape artist Harry Houdini, no matter how little they know about his life, knows one thing about his death.",David Mikkelson,2001-05-02,Escape artist Harry Houdini died from a ruptured appendix caused by his being punched in the stomach.

"Mary I of England (1553-1558) was anything but a famed beauty terrified of losing her looks — she was a matronly, fortyish woman who had about as much sense of style as a dust mop. The idea of her bathing in the blood of slaughtered virgins to preserve her loveliness is ludicrous. She came by the moniker ""Bloody Mary"" because she had a number of Protestants put to death during her reign, as she tried to re-establish Catholicism as the religion of the land after the reigns of her father (Henry VIII, he who married six wives over the course of his lifetime and established himself as the head of a new religion rather than tolerate the Pope's saying he couldn't divorce wife #1 to marry wife #2) and her brother (Edward VI, who ruled after Henry died but passed away himself at the age of 16). Mary was a devoutly religious woman who saw what she was doing as the saving of her subjects' souls from eternal damnation, and in those times — as crazy as this sounds now — the eternal wellbeing of a soul was deemed far more important than the comparatively fleeting life of a person. That bringing the country back to Catholicism would also safeguard her throne was also a major consideration.",6,Is the Bloody Mary Story True?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bloody-mary-story/,legend,Will chanting 'Bloody Mary' 13 times in front of a darkened mirror summon a vengeful ghost?,Barbara Mikkelson,2001-04-27,"Chanting ""Bloody Mary!"" thirteen times in front of a candlelit mirror will summon a vengeful spirit."

"The concept of mirrors as portals between this world and the realm of spirits shows up in other beliefs, namely those surrounding funerals. It was common practice to cover mirrors in a house where a death had occurred until the body was taken for burial. (Back in the days before funeral homes, corpses were washed by the deceased's relatives, dressed in their funeral finery, and laid out in coffins in the front parlor. Consequently, the dead would be in the house for days.) It was believed if the dear departed caught a glimpse of himself in a mirror, his ghost would remain in the house because the mirror would trap his spirit.

"Three or four spider species live in most North American homes, and they all tend to be found either tending their webs or hunting in nonhuman-infested areas. During their forays, they usually don’t intentionally crawl into a bed because it offers no prey (unless it has bed bugs, in which case that person has bigger problems). Spiders also have no interest in humans.

"From the standpoint of human biology, the oral spider myth also seems ridiculous. If someone is sleeping with her mouth open, she's probably snoring — and thus scaring off any eight-legged transgressors.

The ad showed an unmoving man wearing sunglasses seated at a desk. Throughout the day various assignments were placed on his desk and then picked up, completed, and dropped back at his desk by co-workers. At the end of the day the wife appears to pick him up. She is complimented on her husband’s diligence and performance, shoos the appreciative co-worker away, closes the door to her husband's office, and begins to prepare him to leave. The voice-over on the commercial comments on how it's important to be prepared for the unexpected, leaving behind the unstated message that otherwise you too might have to day after day prop your dead husband at his desk at work to keep those paychecks coming in.",10,Man Dies at His Desk,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/working-stiff/,false,Did a man who die at his desk and remain undiscovered until 5 days later?,David Mikkelson,2001-03-17,A man who died at his office desk went unnoticed by his co-workers for five days.
"Origins: The rumor of a large number of HIV-positive high school kids having being discovered through the Red Cross' rejection of their blood has been with us since at least 1987, and it has moved around the country at will, attaching itself to whichever high school just hosted a blood drive.",1,Student AIDS,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/student-aids/,false,Blood drive at the local high school reveals 20% of the students were HIV positive?,Barbara Mikkelson,2001-03-17,"When the Red Cross conducted a volunteer blood drive at a local high school recently, they uncovered a shocking truth: 20% of the student donors were HIV-positive."
"Though its venue changes, the story remains the same — some horrific number of fresh-faced youngsters are discovered to be living under a death sentence. The infected percentage of the student body varies from 10 to 82 depending on who is doing the telling, with 12% (1 in 8) and 20% (1 in 5) the clear front runners.",2,Student AIDS,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/student-aids/,false,Blood drive at the local high school reveals 20% of the students were HIV positive?,Barbara Mikkelson,2001-03-17,"When the Red Cross conducted a volunteer blood drive at a local high school recently, they uncovered a shocking truth: 20% of the student donors were HIV-positive."
"For example (the legend is certainly not limited to these communities), the rumor has raced through Chicago (1992, 20% of the students in one particular high school), Los Angeles (1992, 12%), Dubuque (1996, ""dozens of students""), Kansas City (1996, 15%), Orlando (1992, ""dozens""), Seattle (1992, 15%), St. Petersburg (1991, 20%), Orange County, CA (1987, 14%), Sonoma County, CA (82%, 2001).",3,Student AIDS,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/student-aids/,false,Blood drive at the local high school reveals 20% of the students were HIV positive?,Barbara Mikkelson,2001-03-17,"When the Red Cross conducted a volunteer blood drive at a local high school recently, they uncovered a shocking truth: 20% of the student donors were HIV-positive."
"What's the real story here? The American Red Cross began testing blood for HIV in 1985. By 1996 there had been 28 donors confirmed as HIV-positive, out of 1.65 million blood donations nationwide. Only one of those infected was a high school student.

"The use of specific numbers in the claim lends the dire tidings more authority, yet they are still hogwash. For instance, with regard to the rumor we quote as our example (Conant High School, blood drawn from 317 seniors,61 tested positive for HIV), we know the real numbers for that school's blood drive: 125 students and 37 faculty members gave blood, and not one of them was HIV-positive.",5,Student AIDS,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/student-aids/,false,Blood drive at the local high school reveals 20% of the students were HIV positive?,Barbara Mikkelson,2001-03-17,"When the Red Cross conducted a volunteer blood drive at a local high school recently, they uncovered a shocking truth: 20% of the student donors were HIV-positive."
"In 1992 in the small Texas town of Bogata, a health worker's announcement that she knew of six cases of AIDS at the small (197 students) Rivercrest High School appeared to confirm the rumor. Dona Atkins (then Dona Spence), a case manager at Ark-Tex Council of Governments, a regional planning agency, said each of the teens came to her for counseling. She never named names or produced the teens but always stood by her story. On the other hand, no confirmation of what she asserted ever emerged, no infected teenagers came forward, none subsequently sickened and died, and the Texas Department of Health reported that its investigation could find no basis for her claims. Moreover, she'd been caught telling untruths before, stating she'd served as an Army nurse for 17 years, including in Vietnam, yet military records showed she wasn't a registered nurse in Texas or California and had two short stints in the military, neither of which were in Vietnam. She would have had a motive for telling a false story; her husband had contracted AIDS from a blood transfusion, and his illness and subsequent demise in 1989 had moved her to speak to teenagers and the community about AIDS prevention. It is not unknown for those who feel their important messages aren't being heard clearly enough to personalize the dangers they warn against by inventing especially tragic victims whose stories they can use to drive home the validity of their admonishments.",6,Student AIDS,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/student-aids/,false,Blood drive at the local high school reveals 20% of the students were HIV positive?,Barbara Mikkelson,2001-03-17,"When the Red Cross conducted a volunteer blood drive at a local high school recently, they uncovered a shocking truth: 20% of the student donors were HIV-positive."
"heightened sense of awareness among teenagers that AIDS is a real possibility in their lives probably lies at the bottom of this rumor. It is known that HIV is discovered through blood tests, and that the Red Cross runs such tests on all the blood donations it collects. Teen fear plus a blood drive makes this rumor a natural to sweep through a school once the Bloodmobile has driven off down the street.",7,Student AIDS,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/student-aids/,false,Blood drive at the local high school reveals 20% of the students were HIV positive?,Barbara Mikkelson,2001-03-17,"When the Red Cross conducted a volunteer blood drive at a local high school recently, they uncovered a shocking truth: 20% of the student donors were HIV-positive."
"Fears are also likely fed by the sight of school chums being told they can't donate blood. Though potential donors are turned away if they are not feeling well, have slightly elevated temperatures, demonstrate low red cell counts, have recently weathered fevers or colds, have gotten tattoos in the last year, or if it has not been the required 56 days since they last gave blood, none of those explanations are likely to occur to the students who notice that buddies who went to give blood afterwards lack the telltale bandages on their arms. The rumor of the turn-downs being due to AIDS is a tantalizing scenario likely to be spread by impressionable high schoolers. Yet, though superficially plausible, the rationale behind such a whisper is seriously flawed — were someone unknowingly contaminated, said infection wouldn't be discovered until the donated blood was examined back at the lab because there is no way on site to tell whether a person tests positive for HIV.",8,Student AIDS,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/student-aids/,false,Blood drive at the local high school reveals 20% of the students were HIV positive?,Barbara Mikkelson,2001-03-17,"When the Red Cross conducted a volunteer blood drive at a local high school recently, they uncovered a shocking truth: 20% of the student donors were HIV-positive."
It's possible parents and teachers do their bit to keep this rumor up and running — the use of scare tactics to dissuade young people from engaging in risky behaviors is nothing new. A story of a nearby high school's blood drive turning up so many HIV-positive kids would serve to drive home the message that there's nothing safe about teen sex.,9,Student AIDS,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/student-aids/,false,Blood drive at the local high school reveals 20% of the students were HIV positive?,Barbara Mikkelson,2001-03-17,"When the Red Cross conducted a volunteer blood drive at a local high school recently, they uncovered a shocking truth: 20% of the student donors were HIV-positive."

"Origins: The motif of the careless driver who runs into things (including people) without realizing it until someone else points out objects or bodies stuck to his car has generic antecedents in sea tales about equally careless captains whose ships are found to have items such as bodies, wreckage, and parts of other ships entwined in their anchors and rigging.

"Automobile versions (featuring non-drunk drivers who hit pedestrians or cats) were probably circulating decades before the current form of the drunk driver unaware that he has run over a child.

"With the increased attention brought to bear on the problem of drunk driving in the 1970s and 1980s by organizations such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), the adaptation of a bit of urban folklore into a useful piece of ""scarelore"" is not surprising. Many apocryphal drug horror tales have long served a similar purpose in the campaign against drug abuse. As we often find in tales intended to focus our attention on one of society's lurking dangers, the innocent victim is one chosen to provoke maximum moral outrage: in this case, an eight-year-old girl.",5,Dead Body on Car,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bar-and-grille/,legend,Drunk driver discovers body of little girl stuck to the front of his car.,David Mikkelson,2001-03-11,"The morning after an all-night drinking binge, a man discovers the body of a little girl embedded in his car's grille."

"One known case apparently involved a completely unaware motorist, although the driver's failure to comprehend he had killed a pedestrian was due to dementia, not excessive drinking. In October 2005, news accounts reported that 93-year-old Ralph Parker was stopped after driving through a toll booth on Florida's Sunshine Skyway when a toll taker noticed a body on the front of his car and alerted police. Parker had struck a 52-year-old pedestrian, severing his leg and killing him, then driven for three miles with the victim's body protruding through his windshield. An official with the state attorney's office said it was unlikely Parker would be prosecuted since he did not appear to know where he was or what had transpired.",8,Dead Body on Car,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bar-and-grille/,legend,Drunk driver discovers body of little girl stuck to the front of his car.,David Mikkelson,2001-03-11,"The morning after an all-night drinking binge, a man discovers the body of a little girl embedded in his car's grille."

"Seventy-three seconds into the 28 January 1986 flight of the space shuttle Challenger the craft broke apart, killing the seven astronauts aboard. Videotapes released by NASA afterwards showed that a few seconds before the disaster, an unusual plume of fire and smoke could be seen spewing from the lower section of the shuttle's right solid-fuel rocket.

"NASA later conceded it was likely that at least three of the crew members aboard remained conscious after the explosion, and perhaps even throughout the few minutes it took forthe crew compartment of the shuttle to fall back to Earth and slam into the Atlantic Ocean. The agency was highly secretive about matters relating to the Challenger tragedy, actively fighting in the courts media requests to be allowed access to photographs of the wreckage, the details of the settlements made with the crews' families, or the autopsy reports, and this reticence to share information likely convinced some that there was more to the story than was being told.",2,Are These the Final Words of the Challenger Crew?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/challenger-crew-tape/,false,Reports of a secret tape recorded aboard the doomed space shuttle Challenger that captured the final panic-stricken moments of the crew raised suspicions of a cover-up.,Brooke Binkowski,2001-02-22,A secret tape recorded aboard the doomed space shuttle Challenger captured the final panic-stricken moments of the crew.
"When the shuttle broke apart, the crew compartment did not lose pressure, at least not at once. There was an uncomfortable jolt — ""A pretty good kick in the pants"" is the way one investigator describes it — but it was not so severe as to cause injury. This probably accounted for the ""uh oh"" that was the last word heard on the flight deck tape recorder that would be recovered from the ocean floor two months later. As they were feeling the jolt, the four astronauts on the flight deck saw a bright flash and a cloud of steam. The lights went out. The intercom went dead.

"Though the shuttle had broken to pieces, the crew compartment was intact. It stabilized in a nose-down attitude within 10 to 20 seconds, say the investigators.

"Not everyone aboard died the exact second the external tank exploded; that much is known. A complete understanding of exactly what happened in that cabin after the explosion remains elusive because the impact of the crash, plus the six weeks the wreckage and bodies spent in the sea, made it impossible to determine precisely when and how everybody aboard died.

"If the cabin depressurized immediately, the crew would have lived about 6 to 15 seconds after the blast; if not, they might have survived for the full two minutes and forty-five seconds it took the cabin to fall 65,000 feet back to Earth. They most certainly could not have lived through the crushing 207 mph impact with the waters off the Florida coast, which negates the wilder versions of ""survived astronauts"" rumors that had them still alive for hours (and even days) under the sea, waiting for rescuers who could not reach them in time.",14,Are These the Final Words of the Challenger Crew?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/challenger-crew-tape/,false,Reports of a secret tape recorded aboard the doomed space shuttle Challenger that captured the final panic-stricken moments of the crew raised suspicions of a cover-up.,Brooke Binkowski,2001-02-22,A secret tape recorded aboard the doomed space shuttle Challenger captured the final panic-stricken moments of the crew.
"Possibly the best clue towards solving the mystery of how long the doomed crew survived lies in what NASA learned from examining the four emergency air packs recovered from the wreckage. Three had been manually activated, which demonstrated that at least some of the crew realized something had gone wrong and had taken steps to save themselves. However, the fourth unactivated pack speaks with an even stronger voice, indicating that most likely realization of the circumstances and loss of consciousness were occurring at roughly the same time.",15,Are These the Final Words of the Challenger Crew?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/challenger-crew-tape/,false,Reports of a secret tape recorded aboard the doomed space shuttle Challenger that captured the final panic-stricken moments of the crew raised suspicions of a cover-up.,Brooke Binkowski,2001-02-22,A secret tape recorded aboard the doomed space shuttle Challenger captured the final panic-stricken moments of the crew.

"One of the most famous intravenous drugs for generating stories about bizarre behavior was phencyclidine: ""angel dust,"" or ""PCP."" Although little is heard anymore about angel dust, it was well known for its ability to both addle and confer superhuman powers upon its abusers, or so the stories went. Tales of ""some guy who was dusted"" going berserk and beating up six cops before fifteen more managed to subdue him abounded. In my work in the [New York General Hospital], I witnessed some exceedingly strange dust-induced behavior, including one patient who'd done the most bizarre thing to himself I'd ever seen or heard of in my life. This man smoked dust one day and surprised his friends by politely excusing himself to the bathroom, bringing along his two Doberman pinschers. In the bathroom he opened the medicine cabinet, removed a straightedge razor, cut off his own facial features one by one, and fed them to his dogs. He emerged from the bathroom with no ears, nose, eyelids, lips, or cheeks, and two happy-looking dogs. His friends, now fairly distraught, brought him to the NYG emergency room, where the plastic and head and neck surgeons pissed in their pants with excitement. They took him straight to the operating room. Jokes emerged immediately. The man lost face, the surgeons tried to save face, etc., etc. In order to create a new face for this unfortunate patient, the surgeons did a ""pectoral flap,"" a fascinating procedure in which the pectoral (chest) muscle is removed and reimplanted at another site on a patient's body. The surgeon's don't remove the muscle completely, but leave intact is main artery and vein. The muscle is then ""flapped"" to the spot where it's needed, presumably a hole that is too deep to be filled by mere skin grafting, and sewn in place. Eventually, it grows a new blood supply at the transplant site and the surgeons remove the original artery and vein. The man with no face had two pectoral flaps done, one from each side of his chest to each side of his face. Once the muscles were well established in their new locations the surgeons took him back to the OR about two hundred times to cut and shape and revise the graft to create a new face for him. I know the story of the man with no face is true because I saw him walking down the hall a few weeks after he was admitted. He was wearing a surgical hood turned back in front, with two holes cut out for his eyes, like the ""elephant man."" I whispered to a co-resident, ""Who's that?"" He looked at me with wide eyes.

(He had not noticed the hypodermic when he poured himself a drink from the can; he found the needle the next day.) Soon afterwards, similar reports flooded in from all over the USA.

"Pepsi and the Food and Drug Administration soon ruled out product tampering as the cause of these ""finds."" It quickly became obvious the beverager was the victim of a spontaneous hoax.

"Once Pepsi and the FDA was sure they knew what was going on, Pepsi launched an all-out campaign to reassure alarmed customers who dreaded getting stuck by needles secreted in their drinks. Officials at bottling plants threw open their doors to the press, demonstrating how it was virtually impossible to place an object in a can, and pointing out that even if that were accomplished, the tampered can would be easy to detect. (In 1993 Pepsi was producing 2,000 cans a minute at 150 plants on high-speed canning lines in which cans were inverted, shot with a blast of air or water, and then turned right side up and filled. Since the cans were open for only nine-tenths of a second, someone would have had to be awful quick to get a syringe into any of them.)

The ads included lists of ""dos and don'ts"" for consumers and provided a toll-free number winners could use to find out how to claim prizes that defective cans failed to eject.

This photo (along with others now lost) was snapped by my parents in 1969 as the three of us (and numerous others) observed the bears as they came to browse the park's garbage dump at twilight. Though we maintained what we felt was a safe distance, in truth we were placing our trust in the bears' preoccupation with their garbagy finds.

The news agency United Press International picked up the story after they spoke to a police lieutenant who confirmed both that he had seen the finger and that the hospital had examined it.

"Yet it wasn't true, although members of her family attempted to blur the line between what had happened to Diane and her use of drugs as a possible cause for it. We can only speculate upon their reasons for doing so, but we should note that it is not all uncommon for those left behind after a suicide to work to convince others the death was one of misadventure and not the deliberate ending of a life. There is still a stigma attached to suicide, and families may view cloaking such matters in more socially acceptable terms as one final act of loyalty they can perform for the one who has gone before. (At one time the stigma was far greater and bore serious consequences that could impact upon the fate of the suicide's mortal soul. Those who had taken their lives could not be interred in hallowed ground.

"Those who are left to grieve sometimes choose to reject evidence of deliberate suicide in favor of the more comforting fiction of accidental death. This act of self-deception serves to cocoon them from a pain too terrible to bear.

How much harder it is to attempt to deal with a child's death by suicide when confronted by questions such as: Was there something I was supposed to notice? Was there something I could have done? If I'd listened a bit harder, could I have prevented this? For some, the only answer is to refuse to acknowledge that there was a suicide, or to adopt a view of events that exaggerates the importance of outside factors upon the final outcome, thus lessening the suicide's responsibility for his actions.

"Art Linkletter (who was with his wife and another daughter in Colorado at the time of Diane's death), claimed within scant hours of the tragedy that Diane had been under the influence of LSD when she jumped, maintaining: ""It isn't suicide because she wasn't herself. It was murder. She was murdered by the people who manufacture and sell LSD."" Linkletter made this statement — which would be widely repeated and relied upon as the cause of her death — before an autopsy had even been started. He went on to say that he had known for six months Diane had experimented with LSD before. According to him, Diane had experienced ""minor problems"" six months before her death and had sought relief from them through LSD; instead of relief, however, she found a bad trip which left her hallucinating long after the effects of the drug should have worn off.",16,Death of Diane Linkletter,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-scarlet-linkletter/,false,"Did Art Linkletter's daughter, Diane, jump out a window while high on LSD?",Barbara Mikkelson,2000-12-27,"Thinking she could fly, Diane Linkletter accidentally jumped to her death while high on LSD."
"Diane's ""bad trip"" hasn't been confirmed by anyone else, although her father made constant reference to it AFTER her death. (He is quoted in the April 1970 issue of Good Housekeeping, for example, as saying ""Diane herself, six months before her death, had told us she had tried LSD and had had a bad trip. We sat down and talked for a long time, and she agreed it was a dangerous and stupid thing to do; that she wouldn't do it again. And I don't think she did, although I can't be sure."")",17,Death of Diane Linkletter,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-scarlet-linkletter/,false,"Did Art Linkletter's daughter, Diane, jump out a window while high on LSD?",Barbara Mikkelson,2000-12-27,"Thinking she could fly, Diane Linkletter accidentally jumped to her death while high on LSD."
"Was Diane a drug user with a history of bad trips, and did remnants of one of them ultimately work to impel her to take her own life? Or did a famous family which had weathered the shock of another suicide just three months earlier invent a story that would allow them to present their deceased child as a victim of society's ills and not as an emotionally unstable young woman overwhelmed by the pressures upon her to succeed and by her own inability to make much of a mark in the world independent of her family? Or did brother Robert, when called upon to deliver horrifying news to his parents, invent a scenario on the spur of the moment that would help soften the blow?",18,Death of Diane Linkletter,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-scarlet-linkletter/,false,"Did Art Linkletter's daughter, Diane, jump out a window while high on LSD?",Barbara Mikkelson,2000-12-27,"Thinking she could fly, Diane Linkletter accidentally jumped to her death while high on LSD."
"(Three months earlier, on 15 July 1969, the family had endured a similar loss when John Zweyer, 33, husband of Art Linkletter's oldest daughter, Dawn, shot himself in the head in the backyard of his Hollywood home.

"Whatever the reason for the unshakeable conviction Diane's death was drug-related, this belief motivated her father to become a crusader in the war against drugs. He lectured ceaselessly for the cause, and his speeches and writings on the topic are as fairly presented, persuasive, and non-preaching as any that could be produced by one who passionately believes in a cause and is determined to spare others the tragedy he has known. Art Linkletter's ability to speak directly to others as a grieving father cast adrift in a world of no clear answers yet permeated by a clear and present danger that could strike in any home gave him the power to be heard. Some have accused him of turning Diane's casket into a podium, but even if that's true, he has certainly made effective and excellent use of it.",20,Death of Diane Linkletter,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-scarlet-linkletter/,false,"Did Art Linkletter's daughter, Diane, jump out a window while high on LSD?",Barbara Mikkelson,2000-12-27,"Thinking she could fly, Diane Linkletter accidentally jumped to her death while high on LSD."
"Even prior to his daughter's death, however, Art Linkletter was vitally concerned with what he saw as the eroding state of family values, and he was actively engaged in lecturing across country on the chosen topic of ""Permissiveness in this Society."" (Indeed, he'd been in Colorado to deliver such a talk at the time of Diane's death.) He had also just released a record called ""A Letter to a Teenager"" (also known as ""We Love You; Call Collect""). The flip side contained a rebuttal performed by Diane, which was called ""Dear Mom and Dad."" (Both had been recorded a year or two earlier.

"Martin Wark wrote these words for the father in the piece, played by Art: ""There can be harm in doing too much, and danger in doing too little. A time for holding on and a time for letting go.

"This story was told me by my cousin, who had heard it from a friend in Leeds, about a couple whom he knew, who went for a camping holiday in Spain with their car. They had taken his stepmother with them. She slept in a different tent to the others. On the morning that they struck [broke camp], they were very busy, and they didn't hear anything of her for a while, and then, when they went to her tent, they found she had died, and rigor had already set in. They were in a great state, and they didn't know what to do, but they decided to roll her up in the tent, and put her on top of the car, and go to the nearest town, and go to the consul and the police. So they did this, and went to the town, and then they felt very cold and miserable, and they hadn't had a proper breakfast. So they thought they'd get a cup of coffee to revive them, before they went in search of the consul. So they parked the car, and went to a small cafe, and had their cup of coffee, and then came back to look for the car. But it wasn't there. It had gone.",2,Granny on the Roof Rack,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/my-mother-the-cargo/,legend,Did a car thief steal an automobile with a dead body in it?,Barbara Mikkelson,2000-12-17,"An old woman traveling in a car filled with relatives dies during a long journey.

"It happened to a family friend as they were traveling across the desert to California. Within this station wagon there was a father, a mother and their children, and the mother-in-law who everyone called ""Grandma."" And as they were going across the desert Grandma became sick and she died. Now they didn't want to alarm the children and they didn't want to leave Grandma out in the desert so the only place they had room for her where she — her smell wouldn't bother the children — was to strap her on top of the station wagon along with the baggage with a tarp over her, of course. And as they were traveling across the desert they kept looking for a town where they could deposit Grandma. They finally arrived in a small town in Arizona where they stopped at a filling station and they went in to report Grandma's death. And while they were within the filling station somebody stole the station wagon and when they went out — no station wagon and no Grandma! Well, it wasn't very funny even though it sounds like it because they have to wait seven years now to prove that Grandma is dead before they can collect any insurance. And they've never been able to find either the car or Grandma.

"Deciding that the old woman would hate not to be buried in her beloved Blighty, the family set about returning her home, and, mindful of the customs and other problems they might face, they resolved to hide her. So they bought a cheap bit of carpet, and rolled the wrinkled little corpse up in it. Granny's body was by now too stiff to bend on to a car seat, so they had to strap her on the roof-rack.

"European renditions generally end with the family's discovery of the theft, a detail possibly related to why the body is being transported in the first place (usually out of filial desire to do right by the departed by bringing her home for proper burial).

"Throughout the legend's numerous tellings, Granny is never once portrayed as loved and valued, someone whose loss is felt and indeed mourned. Those left to cope with her death treat her as a non-person — their major concern becomes what to do with the decaying body, not how to come to terms with the passing of someone deeply cared about. There's no sense of tears being shed; it's all bundle up the body and get rid of it. Even in the odd telling where mention is made of the family being thrown into a great state by the discovery of Granny's demise, the focus is on their shock at happening upon a death and having to deal with the question of what to do with a corpse, not upon their grief over the loss of a family member.",8,Granny on the Roof Rack,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/my-mother-the-cargo/,legend,Did a car thief steal an automobile with a dead body in it?,Barbara Mikkelson,2000-12-17,"An old woman traveling in a car filled with relatives dies during a long journey.

"Figuratively a burden to the family during her life, Granny becomes a literal burden in death. Once deceased, she is dealt with in a manner reflective of how nuclear families often deal with their elderly — she's distanced from the vital center of the family and stashed out of sight.

"The twist at the end of the North American versions becomes stunningly appropriate under that analysis — the theft of the body causes a delay in the probate of Granny's will.

The victim is always a teenage girl, and a sorority initiation dare is what usually serves to impel her to sit in the statue's lap.

"A marble gravestone in an old deserted cemetery in West Virginia was the legend trip site for a particular group of young adults in the vicinity. The marble statue was of a seated lady, her hands outstretched to all that pass by the resting place. The legend stated that the woman in the grave had died of a broken heart when jilted by her fiancé. The legend trip was an initiation rite: new members had to spend the night sitting in the statue's lap. But the last time anyone tried this, the young woman who sat in the statue's lap met with a tragedy. The difference, you see, was that the young woman was a direct descendant of the fiancé!",2,Did a Statue Called Black Agnes Kill a Teenage Girl?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/black-agnes/,legend,Horror legend holds that a teenage girl was found dead in the arms of a graveyard statue.,Barbara Mikkelson,2000-11-05,A teenage girl who bets her friends she can spend the night in a cemetery is found dead in the arms of a graveyard statue.
"The ""killing statue"" story is closely related to another venerable legend, that of the girl who accepts a dare to spend a night in the graveyard. (Variations on its basic theme go back to the Middle Ages in Europe.) As part of the dare — or prompted by her own disrespect — she plunges a knife into a grave. In the morning she's found lying dead across the plot, the knife pinning her skirt to the ground having prevented her from escaping. Died of fright, they say, with a look of terror etched on her face. (One is left to work out whether a ghost had actually killed her, or whether her fear at finding herself held to the grave had done her in.)",3,Did a Statue Called Black Agnes Kill a Teenage Girl?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/black-agnes/,legend,Horror legend holds that a teenage girl was found dead in the arms of a graveyard statue.,Barbara Mikkelson,2000-11-05,A teenage girl who bets her friends she can spend the night in a cemetery is found dead in the arms of a graveyard statue.
My grandmother used to tell this: A young girl had a pajama party with several of her teenage friends attending. Shortly before midnight she told her guests that there was a grave in the edge of the woods behind her house and anyone going there on a full moon and standing to close to the grave would be pulled into the grave by the bony hand of the old man buried there. One 15 year old girl scoffed at the story and after much teasing accepted the challenge of going alone to the grave. As proof she had actually gone all the way she was to stick a fork into the top of the grave for inspection by all the others the next morning. The girl left and did not return. The others mourned her absence until morning - afraid to wake the adults in the house - fearful they were in serious trouble. Next morning they all huddled together and nervously made their way to the grave. There they found their friend lying dead beside the grave with her long night gown pinned to the grave where she had stuck the fork thru her night gown and into the hard clay covering the grave.,4,Did a Statue Called Black Agnes Kill a Teenage Girl?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/black-agnes/,legend,Horror legend holds that a teenage girl was found dead in the arms of a graveyard statue.,Barbara Mikkelson,2000-11-05,A teenage girl who bets her friends she can spend the night in a cemetery is found dead in the arms of a graveyard statue.
"Getting back to killer statues, we note the legend of Black Agnes is peculiar to Baltimore, Maryland, and it sprang up around a sculpture that started out as a grave marker in Loudon Park Cemetery. The evocative statue of a seated, mournful figure of indeterminate gender was christened Black Aggie, and fraternity/sorority initiations sprang up around it. In an effort to thwart those rituals, Black Aggie was moved to Druid Hill Park. The problems continued there, so in 1967 the statue was dispatched to the Smithsonian Institution. She now resides at the federal courts building in Washington, D.C., off I Street, in a rear courtyard of the Dolley Madison House.",5,Did a Statue Called Black Agnes Kill a Teenage Girl?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/black-agnes/,legend,Horror legend holds that a teenage girl was found dead in the arms of a graveyard statue.,Barbara Mikkelson,2000-11-05,A teenage girl who bets her friends she can spend the night in a cemetery is found dead in the arms of a graveyard statue.
"The statue did once mark a final resting place in Baltimore — but not of a woman, as you might suppose. No, the person buried under Aggie was Felix Agnus (1839-1925), a Union Civil War general. Facts be damned though, kids were determined to believe Aggie was the representation of the person in the grave, and further that the dead person had died a heartbroken woman, hence her need to wreak vengeance from the other side. Aggie's eyes were said to burn bright red at midnight, permanently blinding anyone foolish enough to look into them. Lying in her arms was said to be fatal.",6,Did a Statue Called Black Agnes Kill a Teenage Girl?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/black-agnes/,legend,Horror legend holds that a teenage girl was found dead in the arms of a graveyard statue.,Barbara Mikkelson,2000-11-05,A teenage girl who bets her friends she can spend the night in a cemetery is found dead in the arms of a graveyard statue.
"Oddly enough, the statue that started out in Baltimore and ended up in Washington was a copy of one already in Washington. The original can be found in Rock Creek Cemetery, where it marks the graves of Marian and Henry Adams. In 1866, depressed by the death of her father, Marian Adams swallowed potassium cyanide while her husband was paying an emergency Sunday visit to his dentist. Grief-stricken over her loss to the end of his life, Adams commissioned a special monument from the well-known sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. The statue has come to be called ""Grief,"" although it never was officially so named either by its creator or its patron. There is no writing to be found on it, so very few know it's actually the grave marker of both Henry and Marian (he joined her underneath there in 1918) and not just a lovely bit of statuary.",7,Did a Statue Called Black Agnes Kill a Teenage Girl?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/black-agnes/,legend,Horror legend holds that a teenage girl was found dead in the arms of a graveyard statue.,Barbara Mikkelson,2000-11-05,A teenage girl who bets her friends she can spend the night in a cemetery is found dead in the arms of a graveyard statue.
"It's ironic that the original statue (which is erected over the grave of a grief-stricken woman) never became a target either for fraternity initiation rites or for murdering ghost legends, whereas the Baltimore copy (erected over the grave of Civil War General who'd lived a full and rewarding life) did.

"Putting the crazed Halloween poisoner story to rest can be quite the task, as was outlined in a 9 November 1989 article in the Los Angeles Times.

"Well, they found a total of 78 cases and two deaths.

"""My favorite,"" Best says, ""was the kid who brought a half-eaten candy bar to his parents and said, 'I think there's ant poison on this.'

"Sad to say, foreign objects hidden in Halloween loot are part of the trick-or-treat experience, but these incidents are few and far between, and our fear of them is greatly out of proportion with the likelihood of their occurring.

"These cases constitute a different class of tampering than poisoning for a couple of reasons. First, the expected level of harm is severely reduced: poison is an attempt to kill; a pin in an apple is an attempt to frighten or injure. Professor Joel Best reported that he was able to track about eighty cases of sharp objects in food incidents since 1959, and almost all were hoaxes. Only about ten culminated in even minor injury, and in the worst case, a woman required a few stitches. Compared to ""eat something and die,"" a couple of stitches barely registers on the scale.",1,Pins and Needles in Halloween Candy,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pins-and-needles/,true,"Pins, needles and razor blades been occasionally been found in trick-or-treaters' loot over the years.",Snopes Staff,2000-11-01,"Pins, needles, and razor blades have been found in trick-or-treaters' loot."
"Second, the motivation for ""pins and needles"" tampering is different. As I said before, poison is an attempt to kill, but hiding a needle in an apple is almost always a prank, not a serious attempt to cause harm. (In those instances where such an insertion could be traced back to a specific person, it was almost always some kid intent on freaking out either his little brother or his parents or getting the community in an uproar as his version of a cute Halloween ""trick""). Pranking (especially when it's a scary or slightly mean one) is part of Halloween, and the various kids or young adults who've tampered with treats most likely never fully considered the potential consequences of the joke prior to embarking on it. (When presented with a matchless opportunity to throw a scare into a pesky kid brother, who stops to think that Junior might get hurt?)",2,Pins and Needles in Halloween Candy,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pins-and-needles/,true,"Pins, needles and razor blades been occasionally been found in trick-or-treaters' loot over the years.",Snopes Staff,2000-11-01,"Pins, needles, and razor blades have been found in trick-or-treaters' loot."
"According to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, an incident that broke with this expected pattern occurred in Minneapolis in 2000, when 49-year-old James Joseph Smith was charged with one count of adulterating a substance with intent to cause death, harm or illness after it was determined he'd put needles in Snickers bars and handed them out to children on Halloween. A 14-year-old boy was pricked by a needle hidden in a bar he'd bitten into, but no one required medical attention.",3,Pins and Needles in Halloween Candy,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pins-and-needles/,true,"Pins, needles and razor blades been occasionally been found in trick-or-treaters' loot over the years.",Snopes Staff,2000-11-01,"Pins, needles, and razor blades have been found in trick-or-treaters' loot."
"Beginning in 1967 the focus of the legend shifted dramatically from poison to razors and sharp objects hidden in apples. The emergence of the razor blade motif remains to be studied, but it apparently spread rapidly in several areas of the eastern seaboard and Canada: The New York Times reported thirteen cases from isolated communities in New Jersey and noted ""several"" others in Ottawa and Toronto. Outrage was so strong in New Jersey that the state legislature passed a law shortly before Halloween 1968 mandating prison terms for those caught boobytrapping apples. This did not forestall the discovery of thirteen more apples with razor blades that year in five New Jersey counties.",4,Pins and Needles in Halloween Candy,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pins-and-needles/,true,"Pins, needles and razor blades been occasionally been found in trick-or-treaters' loot over the years.",Snopes Staff,2000-11-01,"Pins, needles, and razor blades have been found in trick-or-treaters' loot."
"In many cases, The New York Times story noted that ""children were cut,"" but the more detailed accounts include suspicious details. In one case a boy came to his parents with an apple containing a razor blade. He had bit into an apple, he said, but not quite deeply enough to contact the blade. In another, the child said he found the blade while cutting out a rotten spot; in a third case, the razor was found when a child turned an apple over to his father for peeling. In all these detailed cases, the child was not injured, and because he was the immediate source of the apple, it seems possible that he was also the source of the blade. As Best and Horiuchi (authors of the Razor Blade) note, more than 75 percent of reported cases involved no injury, and detailed followups in 1972 and 1982 concluded that virtually all the reports were hoaxes concocted by the children or parents. Thus this legend type seems to have grown out of a tradition of ostensive hoaxes relying on an understood oral tradition, rather than on any core of authenticated incidents.",5,Pins and Needles in Halloween Candy,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pins-and-needles/,true,"Pins, needles and razor blades been occasionally been found in trick-or-treaters' loot over the years.",Snopes Staff,2000-11-01,"Pins, needles, and razor blades have been found in trick-or-treaters' loot."
"Halloween of 1982 was the year it all went crazy. That year saw a number of tragic and random non-Halloween poisonings of both foodstuffs and medicines, including the Tylenol poisonings that killed seven people. Although the ""crazed madman tampering with kids' Halloween treats"" had been an established bogeyman for at least the previous fifteen years, it was in the aftermath of the Tylenol poisonings that a sudden spate of Halloween tampering reports erupted. It's as if the murder of those seven unfortunate people opened a forbidden door and now others were free to experiment with playing God, to dispense either life or death as the whim struck them.",6,Pins and Needles in Halloween Candy,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pins-and-needles/,true,"Pins, needles and razor blades been occasionally been found in trick-or-treaters' loot over the years.",Snopes Staff,2000-11-01,"Pins, needles, and razor blades have been found in trick-or-treaters' loot."
"This bit of scarelore dates to at least the late 1970s, and it still makes little logical sense. A dealer looking to recruit new customers would do better to distribute a more addictive drug than LSD, handing out LSD-soaked candy would work far more effectively than passing around LSD-impregnated papers which require the drug to be absorbed through the skin, and elementary school kids are not known for having large incomes to spend on drugs. This ""warning"" also includes a legend within a legend: the notion that strychnine is present in LSD, either because it's a byproduct of the synthesis process, or because it's used to adulterate or ""cut"" the drug. Even if strychnine were present in LSD (for whatever reason), introducing your customers to the world of drugs by giving them samples laced with enough poison to kill them is an extremely poor way of generating repeat business.",1,LSD Tattoos,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/blue-star-acid/,false,Drug dealers hand out LSD-laced tattoos of cartoon characters to schoolchildren?,Barbara Mikkelson,2000-10-16,"Rub-on ""tattoos"" of cartoon characters laced with LSD are handed out to children by unscrupulous drug dealers."
"Not surprisingly, no verified case of LSD-laced transfer tattoos has ever surfaced. The one bit of the story with anything genuine to it at all is the association between cartoon characters and LSD.

These flyers have come to be known as ""Blue Star Acid"" warnings because even though the cartoon characters the tattoos purportedly depict have changed over the years, a blue star is the image most often cited as the one to look out for. This rumor spreads through communities like wildfire because, as always, anything that's perceived to be an immediate danger to children is taken very seriously and immediately passed on, no matter how implausible or unverified it may be. That these flyers are often issued with the imprimatur of the local police department (or some other important-sounding organization) makes them all them more believable to the public.",3,LSD Tattoos,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/blue-star-acid/,false,Drug dealers hand out LSD-laced tattoos of cartoon characters to schoolchildren?,Barbara Mikkelson,2000-10-16,"Rub-on ""tattoos"" of cartoon characters laced with LSD are handed out to children by unscrupulous drug dealers."

"This is a classic cautionary tale intended to keep youngsters from engaging in dangerous practices even when the parents aren't around to watch over them. The legend is generally circulated in one of two forms: as a horrific example of what happened to a heedless little kid riding on a school bus, or the awful fate that befell the beloved family dog allowed to ride with its head lolling out the car window. Both versions are held up as graphic examples to bolster what would otherwise be simple admonishments to kids to keep hands and feet inside vehicles at all times. <IMG WIDTH=170 HEIGHT=82 ALT=""School bus"" SRC=""https://www.snopes.com/uploads/images/horrors/graphics/bus.gif"" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=16 VSPACE=16 BORDER=0>",1,Beheaded Child on Schoolbus,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/head-of-the-class/,legend,Was a little girl hanging out of a school bus window decapitated by a road sign?,Barbara Mikkelson,2000-10-11,A little girl whose habit it was to hang her head out the school bus window was decapitated by a road sign.
"As much as we hate to undermine the effects good parental scaremongering with base facts, to the best of our knowledge there has yet to be a documented case of such a death. Kids riding in school buses have died — some even after hitting their heads on objects outside the bus — but there's yet to be a decapitation as described in the legend, let alone one by a road sign. As for dogs in cars, same thing — we've yet to find an instance of one losing its head in this manner.",2,Beheaded Child on Schoolbus,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/head-of-the-class/,legend,Was a little girl hanging out of a school bus window decapitated by a road sign?,Barbara Mikkelson,2000-10-11,A little girl whose habit it was to hang her head out the school bus window was decapitated by a road sign.
"The closest the legend has come to turning into reality have been the deaths of real teens and pre-teens who stuck their heads out school bus windows, only to smack into poles and trees once the vehicles began to move. In 2010, 11-year-old Tiffany Lynn Ross-DiCicco of Detroit died of injuries received after being struck in the head by a tree branch while waving at a friend from a school bus window. In 1996, 13-year-old Minnesota teenager Charles Johnson was leaning out a school bus window to shout to friends when the bus began to move and his head slammed against a tree. The boy died of his injuries on impact. In 1994, 13-year-old Alicia Brager of New Jersey was leaning out an open window just as the school bus pulled away from the curb at her school, and she hit her head on a utility pole. In 1988, 15-year-old Richard Bailey of New Hampshire also died of head injuries after his attempt to get a better view of a schoolyard fight from inside the bus resulted in his hitting his head on a utility pole when the vehicle pulled away from the curb.",3,Beheaded Child on Schoolbus,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/head-of-the-class/,legend,Was a little girl hanging out of a school bus window decapitated by a road sign?,Barbara Mikkelson,2000-10-11,A little girl whose habit it was to hang her head out the school bus window was decapitated by a road sign.
"As tragic as those deaths are, they aren't the legend. Though they are clear examples of the fatal consequences of not keeping heads inside the bus and thus speak directly to the underlying reason for passing along ""The Beheaded Schoolkid"" (which is to protect the young from their own folly), such real-life events don't contain the most important element of the legend — decapitation.",4,Beheaded Child on Schoolbus,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/head-of-the-class/,legend,Was a little girl hanging out of a school bus window decapitated by a road sign?,Barbara Mikkelson,2000-10-11,A little girl whose habit it was to hang her head out the school bus window was decapitated by a road sign.
"Why the focus on decapitation, you say? The ""beheading"" element is indispensable to the story if the tale is to serve to keep kids safe. Without the gory mental image of a tyke's head lopped off and rolling down the road while inside the bus the now headless body spurts blood everywhere, the tale's message would be in danger of being forgotten. ""Don't stick your head out a vehicle's window because you might get hurt"" just isn't going to rein in a kid the way ""A little girl had her head chopped off for doing exactly what you're doing right now"" will.",5,Beheaded Child on Schoolbus,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/head-of-the-class/,legend,Was a little girl hanging out of a school bus window decapitated by a road sign?,Barbara Mikkelson,2000-10-11,A little girl whose habit it was to hang her head out the school bus window was decapitated by a road sign.
"To be effective as a caution that will be recalled by youngsters and acted upon, the described death has to be especially gruesome. Vivid mental imagery has to serve in place of an adult's understanding of death because kids and young people often have only a tenuous comprehension of their own mortality. Telling them they risk fatally smacking their heads into a pole lacks the requisite shock value to make such a warning memorable. But toss in a beheading and some spurting blood, and at least some of the message is likely to get through. The same principle is at work here that motivates the classic ""Don't run with a stick in your hand"" admonition: Kids are always told ""or you might fall and gouge out your eye,"" never ""or you might fall on it and hurt yourself.""",6,Beheaded Child on Schoolbus,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/head-of-the-class/,legend,Was a little girl hanging out of a school bus window decapitated by a road sign?,Barbara Mikkelson,2000-10-11,A little girl whose habit it was to hang her head out the school bus window was decapitated by a road sign.

"When the ""AIDS Mary"" legend began spreading, AIDS was a fearsome disease: once HIV-positive, the infected lived under a death sentence. That alone would frighten anyone, but tie this deadly disease to the usual apprehensions about sex with anyone (let alone strangers), and a cautionary urban legend results.",3,AIDS Mary,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/aids-mary/,legend,"A long-circulating urban legend, ""AIDS Mary,"" holds that a woman seduces men with the intent of infecting them with HIV.",Barbara Mikkelson,2000-09-27,"The morning after a one-night fling, a man walks into his bathroom and finds the words “WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF AIDS” scrawled on the mirror in lipstick."
"The legend speaks to our fears; as such, it's larger than life, complete with shocking messages of impending death callously delivered. In the ""AIDS Mary"" version (woman infects man), a fellow picks up a young lady for a one-night sexual encounter. Everything goes swimmingly, and he's quite pleased about the whole thing, until the next morning when he awakens to find her gone and the words ""WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF AIDS"" scrawled in lipstick on his bathroom mirror.",4,AIDS Mary,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/aids-mary/,legend,"A long-circulating urban legend, ""AIDS Mary,"" holds that a woman seduces men with the intent of infecting them with HIV.",Barbara Mikkelson,2000-09-27,"The morning after a one-night fling, a man walks into his bathroom and finds the words “WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF AIDS” scrawled on the mirror in lipstick."
"The ""AIDS Harry"" version (man infects woman) usually features a romance of some duration taking place in a faraway place. The depraved infector passes along his good news by way of a gift, which he asks his victim to unwrap once she's on the plane home. Depending upon where you hear this story, the gift will be a minature coffin (ceramic or wooden) or a coffee mug. Whichever item it is, it will invariably be emblazoned with the message ""WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF AIDS.""",5,AIDS Mary,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/aids-mary/,legend,"A long-circulating urban legend, ""AIDS Mary,"" holds that a woman seduces men with the intent of infecting them with HIV.",Barbara Mikkelson,2000-09-27,"The morning after a one-night fling, a man walks into his bathroom and finds the words “WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF AIDS” scrawled on the mirror in lipstick."
"Often given as the reason for the infector's rampage through the ranks of the previously untouched is the justification of his or her having caught the disease from a member of the opposite sex — now the entire gender will be made to pay. This cautionary tale warns against the dangers of promiscuity, but it also brings into play the fear of falling prey to a random act of violence at the hands of a madman.",6,AIDS Mary,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/aids-mary/,legend,"A long-circulating urban legend, ""AIDS Mary,"" holds that a woman seduces men with the intent of infecting them with HIV.",Barbara Mikkelson,2000-09-27,"The morning after a one-night fling, a man walks into his bathroom and finds the words “WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF AIDS” scrawled on the mirror in lipstick."
"There have been actual cases of the HIV-infected engaging in unprotected sex without first informing their partners of their condition. In the largest documented case of its kind, Darnell ""Boss Man"" McGee infected at least 18 women and girls. McGee, 28, had more than 100 known sex partners before he was slain in 1997 in an apparent robbery attempt. In 1998, authorities in New York said 17 people are believed to have HIV infections linked to Nushawn Williams. Such tragedies are real, but the stuff of legends, the deliberate infection of another as a way of exacting revenge on an entire sex has proved elusive to pin down.",7,AIDS Mary,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/aids-mary/,legend,"A long-circulating urban legend, ""AIDS Mary,"" holds that a woman seduces men with the intent of infecting them with HIV.",Barbara Mikkelson,2000-09-27,"The morning after a one-night fling, a man walks into his bathroom and finds the words “WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF AIDS” scrawled on the mirror in lipstick."
"In July 1998 HIV-positive Pamela Wiser of Lewisburg, Tennessee, was picked up by police on a tip from a man she'd slept with. Under questioning, she claimed over the previous year to have had sex with more than 50 men in an effort to take revenge for three years earlier having caught the disease from her then boyfriend.

"Within a few days of her arrest, her story began to change. She revised the number of men exposed down from fifty to five.

"Was the motivation revenge, an inability to say no, or something altogether different? Without cracking open her head and looking in, it's impossible to tell.

"The key difference between legend and real life goes to motivation. The real-life bad guys who don't give their partners a choice by informing them of the risks ahead of time are driven by denial (I'm not really sick; I'm not going to die), indifference (nobody looked out for me), or fear of loss of affection (she won't want me once she finds out about this), whereas the storybook ones are out to exact revenge for the wrong done them. It's the difference between a fiendish rifle-wielding madman cold-bloodedly picking off random freeway drivers, and a self-pitying fool carelessly weaving in and out of traffic, oblivious to the carnage he's causing around him — one is murdering with malice aforethought, and the other is indifferent to harm he might or might not be causing.",11,AIDS Mary,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/aids-mary/,legend,"A long-circulating urban legend, ""AIDS Mary,"" holds that a woman seduces men with the intent of infecting them with HIV.",Barbara Mikkelson,2000-09-27,"The morning after a one-night fling, a man walks into his bathroom and finds the words “WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF AIDS” scrawled on the mirror in lipstick."
"Speaking to the second variety, the 1992 the case of Roy Cornes captured worldwide attention. Dubbed the ""AIDS Timebomb,"" he was accused of knowingly infecting at least four women (one of whom has since died, as has he). He maintained harming others was not his intent, his partners knew of his condition (a claim some of them disputed), and that in a couple of early cases he passed along the virus because he didn't yet understand what precautions to take, while in a later case, he and his fiancee were trying for a baby and she took the risks willingly.",12,AIDS Mary,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/aids-mary/,legend,"A long-circulating urban legend, ""AIDS Mary,"" holds that a woman seduces men with the intent of infecting them with HIV.",Barbara Mikkelson,2000-09-27,"The morning after a one-night fling, a man walks into his bathroom and finds the words “WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF AIDS” scrawled on the mirror in lipstick."
"We're tempted to dismiss his claims of how all this infecting came about, but then we're left scrambling for a reasonable explanation for his actions. Revenge on all women for one particular woman having given him the virus couldn't have been his motive, because he contracted HIV from blood tranfusions. (He was a hemophiliac).

"Hardest of all to classify are the motivations of Gaetan Dugas, AIDS ""Patient Zero."" In 1980 this charming and handsome Canadian airline attendant was diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma (a type of skin cancer). Until his death in 1984, he continued to engage in episodes of unprotected sex with a variety of partners. These were the early days of AIDS (which incidentally didn't get its name until 1982), and what was going on, let alone how it was being transmitted, wasn't at all clear. Back then there was no strong central authority braying out messages that unprotected sex could kill or even that AIDS was communicated through sexual contact. In the absence of that, those with a mind to could well ignore what was slowly surfacing in the press or dismiss it as so much hooey.",14,AIDS Mary,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/aids-mary/,legend,"A long-circulating urban legend, ""AIDS Mary,"" holds that a woman seduces men with the intent of infecting them with HIV.",Barbara Mikkelson,2000-09-27,"The morning after a one-night fling, a man walks into his bathroom and finds the words “WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF AIDS” scrawled on the mirror in lipstick."
"Dugas appeared to move between denial that whatever he had could be transmitted sexually (""Of course I'm going to have sex. Nobody's proven to me that you can spread cancer""), depraved indifference to his partners' wellbeing (""It's their duty to protect themselves. They know what's going on out there. They've heard about this disease""), and a desire to take others with him (""I've got gay cancer. I'm going to die and so are you""). Possibly his rationale came down to something much simpler — he loved sex, if not his partners. Living under a death sentence, perhaps he was determined to enjoy his last moments on earth, and consequences be damned.",15,AIDS Mary,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/aids-mary/,legend,"A long-circulating urban legend, ""AIDS Mary,"" holds that a woman seduces men with the intent of infecting them with HIV.",Barbara Mikkelson,2000-09-27,"The morning after a one-night fling, a man walks into his bathroom and finds the words “WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF AIDS” scrawled on the mirror in lipstick."
"The spectre of the vengeful AIDS carrier looms far larger than the real cases of those whose indifference led them to infect others. In 1995 an Irish priest shocked his congregation with the tale of an HIV-positive woman who had slept with up to 80 young men across four southern Irish counties in a deliberate attempt to infect as many as possible with the deadly AIDS virus. The priest said he had personally traced about 25 of the men, and that five had tested positive for HIV. Scary stuff indeed, and who would doubt the word of a priest?",16,AIDS Mary,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/aids-mary/,legend,"A long-circulating urban legend, ""AIDS Mary,"" holds that a woman seduces men with the intent of infecting them with HIV.",Barbara Mikkelson,2000-09-27,"The morning after a one-night fling, a man walks into his bathroom and finds the words “WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF AIDS” scrawled on the mirror in lipstick."
"Months went by, and although parishioners continued to take the roman-collared vector's word as gospel, health officials could find nothing to substantiate the priest's claims.

"At least one criminal tried to use the gist of the 'AIDS Mary' legend as part of his legal defense. In his trial for the 1990 murder of Linda Hoberg, Jeffrey Hengehold claimed he'd met the victim in a bar and had sex with her later that night; as they were parting, she said, ""Welcome to the world of AIDS.""

"Though Hengehold claimed this was his motive for the murder, there was no evidence to prove it one way or the other.

"The laws of most countries are inadequate when it comes to assessing and penalizing the crime of knowingly transmitting a deadly disease, but at least one of them is moving in the right direction. Britain is even now trying to reform laws to cover this form of assault.

"Sightings: Scary legends also make great movie plots, so it should come as no surprise this legend showed up as the plot of the 1992 German movie Via Appia.

"It was a dark and foggy night. Denise was having trouble staying awake and the road was slick. Her anxiety level was not helped by the fact that she was running low on gas and didn't know where the next town was. Finally, just as she thought she would have to pull over and sleep till morning on the side of the road, a tiny gas station appeared — very rundown, but a gas station nonetheless. She pulled in. The attendant made his way around the car and seemed to be very distracted as she asked him to fill it up, and even seemed to be making faces at her. He finally agreed to get the gas, but then asked her to pop the hood of the car because it ""smelled like trouble."" Her anxiety from being on the road was starting to flare up again, she was all alone in a creepy gas station out in the middle of nowhere and an attendant was finding reasons to keep her there. He asked her to come look at the engine, he had to ""show her something"". Not knowing what else to do, almost as if in a daze, she did as he asked, all the while wondering why she didn't scream. As she rounded the front of the car he grabbed her arm and said, ""This car needs a tow, you'll have to come with me into the office."" Then he put his hand over her mouth and forced her into the office. She began to bite his hand once they were inside and he let her go and said, ""I'm sorry, but there is a man crouched down in the backseat of your car and I didn't want him to know that I'd seen him.""",3,The Killer in the Backseat,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-killer-in-the-backseat/,legend,A crazed killer is discovered hiding in the back seat of woman's car at a gas station.,David Mikkelson,2000-09-26,A good Samaritan warns a female driver about the armed and dangerous man hiding in the back seat of her car.

This is a serious message that came to me by my Father. He was talking to his friend who is a Detective in Garda H.Q in Harcourt Street. The Detective told Dad to pass this on to women. One incident has happened in Dublin but luckily the woman got away. The petrol attendant saw a guy getting into her car and hiding in the back seat. He called her back pretending there was a problem with her credit card. They called the police and they took the guy to Blanch station to be questioned.,16,The Killer in the Backseat,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-killer-in-the-backseat/,legend,A crazed killer is discovered hiding in the back seat of woman's car at a gas station.,David Mikkelson,2000-09-26,A good Samaritan warns a female driver about the armed and dangerous man hiding in the back seat of her car.
"Some time over the weekend, an AREVA employee's (Kent Hancock) daughter and a friend of hers (both in separate cars), stopped at a Hess Gas Station on Timberlake Rd to get gas. One pulled up on one side of the pumps and the other pulled up on the other side and when they were finished, they walked into the store together to pay. When they went inside, the male cashier asked the friend if she was aware that a guy had gotten into the back seat of her car. The 2 of them looked outside and said no that they were not with anyone else and riding alone. They called the Police and within 2 - 3 minutes they showed up, found the guy in the back seat with a gun and arrested him. When they interrogated him, he admitted that it was part of a gang initiation to rape and kill a white girl to get into the gang.

"It was early evening, and a young girl stopped to get petrol. She filled her tank and walked into the store to pay for her petrol.. The cashier told her, 'Don't pay for your petrol yet... walk around the store for a while, and act as if you're picking up some other things to buy. A man just got into the back of your car.

"When the police arrived, they found the man in the back seat of the girl's car and asked him what he was doing. He replied, he was joining a gang, and the initiation to join is to kidnap a woman and bring her back to the gang to be raped by every member of the gang. If the woman was still alive by the time they finish with her then they let her go. According to the police that night, there is a new gang forming here, originating from London . The scary part of this is, because the guy didn't have a weapon on him, the police could only charge him with trespassing....",20,The Killer in the Backseat,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-killer-in-the-backseat/,legend,A crazed killer is discovered hiding in the back seat of woman's car at a gas station.,David Mikkelson,2000-09-26,A good Samaritan warns a female driver about the armed and dangerous man hiding in the back seat of her car.

"Despite the legend's many incarnations and long history, there's little or no record of its ever playing out in real life.

"Though there have been rapes wherein the attacker hid in the back seat of an automobile, they are rather rare occurrences (one example of which took place in the Chicago area in March 2013). As for carjackings, in the overwhelming majority of them the assailant opens the door and gets into the car while the driver is behind the wheel; there's little of this ""lurking in the backseat"" bit.",24,The Killer in the Backseat,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-killer-in-the-backseat/,legend,A crazed killer is discovered hiding in the back seat of woman's car at a gas station.,David Mikkelson,2000-09-26,A good Samaritan warns a female driver about the armed and dangerous man hiding in the back seat of her car.
"Research shows that one true case of ""The Killer in the Backseat"" did occur in 1964 in New York City, when an escaped murderer hid in the backseat of a car. The car, ironically, belonged to a police detective who shot the man. Though the differences between the legend and the true occurrence are vast (the real occurrence did not feature a lone female; it didn't necessarily happen at night; and no third person was involved), the legend may have sprung out of this real incident:",25,The Killer in the Backseat,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-killer-in-the-backseat/,legend,A crazed killer is discovered hiding in the back seat of woman's car at a gas station.,David Mikkelson,2000-09-26,A good Samaritan warns a female driver about the armed and dangerous man hiding in the back seat of her car.
"Even as a horror legend, this one is sexist to the core. As mentioned earlier, the prey is always female and both the evil fiend and the rescuer are male — there are no exceptions to this typecasting (even though men are far more often the victims of killing by strangers than women are). Both male figures are seen as powerful: the fiend for his evilness and mad intent, the rescuer for his coolness in knowing what to do and his ease in dispatching the fiend:",26,The Killer in the Backseat,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-killer-in-the-backseat/,legend,A crazed killer is discovered hiding in the back seat of woman's car at a gas station.,David Mikkelson,2000-09-26,A good Samaritan warns a female driver about the armed and dangerous man hiding in the back seat of her car.
"The woman, by contrast, is portrayed as completely and irredeemably ineffective. In none of the tellings does she catch on to the source of her peril; she always needs a man to set the record straight. (The task of rescuing her from a dangerous situation also falls to a guy; the woman is never involved in either containing the bad guy until the police arrive or in tussling with him if he tries to escape.) Her inability to take care of herself is further driven home by her resolutely acting on the assumption that the man either chasing after her or trying to lure her into the gas station means her harm. Unaided, she can't tell friend from foe.",27,The Killer in the Backseat,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-killer-in-the-backseat/,legend,A crazed killer is discovered hiding in the back seat of woman's car at a gas station.,David Mikkelson,2000-09-26,A good Samaritan warns a female driver about the armed and dangerous man hiding in the back seat of her car.
"In those recountings where anyone's ethnicity is mentioned, the man hiding in the car or the rescuer is invariably black. It's easy to see those versions as a racist reaction to anxiety about being attacked by a member of a feared group: the lurking black man represents the perceived menace of his race, waiting for the proper moment when a back is turned to strike; the rescuer's attempt to warn the victim is ignored because his color marks him as more likely to be an attacker than a protector.",28,The Killer in the Backseat,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-killer-in-the-backseat/,legend,A crazed killer is discovered hiding in the back seat of woman's car at a gas station.,David Mikkelson,2000-09-26,A good Samaritan warns a female driver about the armed and dangerous man hiding in the back seat of her car.
"Update: In late 1999 through early 2002, versions circulating on the Internet which involved prospective gang members looking to kidnap a woman for rape reappeared with surprising frequency. These morphing e-mails contained specific city names (such as Chicago or Boston) and names of local chains of gas stations/convenience stores (such as ""Quik Trip,"" ""Quick Trip,"" ""Quick Stop,"" ""Kwik Trip,"" ""Kwikfill,"" and ""Citgo""). Later versions incorporated the ankle slasher motif from another horror legend and posited that the gang initation required prospective members to bring in dismembered body parts from female victims.",29,The Killer in the Backseat,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-killer-in-the-backseat/,legend,A crazed killer is discovered hiding in the back seat of woman's car at a gas station.,David Mikkelson,2000-09-26,A good Samaritan warns a female driver about the armed and dangerous man hiding in the back seat of her car.

In September 2003, Cpl. Daniel Brub, an Interpol agent at RCMP headquarters in Ottawa, added his imprimatur to the tale when a well-traveled e-mail (gang members after body parts abducting women at gas stations) picked up his official signature. Many understood it to be an official alert from someone speaking on behalf of law enforcement.

"Yet Cpl. Brub wasn't speaking for Interpol or the RCMP, nor was he confirming incidents in the Ottawa area (there haven't been any).

"Supposedly, at another college in the state, a girl was studying late and went back to her dorm room to get some books or notes. So she wouldn’t disturb her roommate, she didn’t turn on the lights when she got her stuff off of her desk.

"A young lady is alone in her apartment. She goes to bed with her dog on the floor beside her. In the middle of the night, she is woken up by a strange sound.

"Details vary wildly from version to version — sometimes the survivor comes looking for a sweater instead of her books, or she's been at a party instead of the library, or she stops by briefly to check on her sick roommate (leaving immediately because she assumes the girl is sleeping). In some versions she returns home to find the police in the process of investigating the murder, and sometimes she's the one who discovers the body, having awakened the next morning to find both the slashed-throat corpse and the note. Depending on who is telling the story, either the girlfriend, or the dog, or both the girlfriend and the dog are found with their throats cut. (In the ""humans can lick too"" versions, the dog is often discovered hanging in the bathroom, the blood from its slashed throat dripping onto the tiles, this dripping sound being the odd noise that wakes the girl who lived through the night.)",4,Aren't You Glad You Didn't Turn on the Light?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/arent-you-glad-you-didnt-turn-on-the-light/,legend,A college student makes a horrifying discovery.,David Mikkelson,2000-09-08,A female college student returns to her dorm room late one evening and discovers her roommate has been murdered.
"The ""Aren't you glad . . ."" and the ""Humans can lick too"" versions are so closely related that it is difficult to think of them as separate legends. Once the details are boiled away, the same basic storyline is revealed in both — a young woman is oblivious to a grisly killing taking place in front of her, and just how close the call was is revealed in the chilling comment left by the murderer. Be it dog or roommate which ends up on the slab, the real horror of the moment is focused on the girl who survives. (Murder victims are a dime a dozen — what makes the blood run cold is the thought of the one who just barely got away.)",5,Aren't You Glad You Didn't Turn on the Light?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/arent-you-glad-you-didnt-turn-on-the-light/,legend,A college student makes a horrifying discovery.,David Mikkelson,2000-09-08,A female college student returns to her dorm room late one evening and discovers her roommate has been murdered.

So, for the first time the mother decided to let him go in by himself to use the men's washroom, rather than going into the womens with her.

"Medieval European versions had Jews torturing and killing a Christian child, with this form of the legend reaching back as early as the fifth century A.D.

"""Blood simple"" legends about feared minorities torturing and murdering helpless tots as part of their religious rituals have shifted from one group to another as the balance of who was in the minority and who was in the majority changed over time. Medieval lore is rife with tales about Jews using Christian children in their presumed diabolical rites, and lore older than that reversed matters with Christians doing like things to Jewish children they'd spirited away. In each case, the feared minority was portrayed as child torturers and murderers, folks it was thus only reasonable to hate.",6,Mutilated Boy,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mutilated-boy/,legend,Did a gang lure a little boy into a washroom and chop off his penis?,Barbara Mikkelson,2000-08-28,A gang lures a little boy into a washroom and chops off his penis.
"As folklorist Jan Brunvand has noted about racist legends: ""As we observe many times in folklore, the prejudices and stereotypes that people are reluctant to voice in direct terms will often surface in very obvious ways in their oral-narrative traditions of joke or legend.""",7,Mutilated Boy,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mutilated-boy/,legend,Did a gang lure a little boy into a washroom and chop off his penis?,Barbara Mikkelson,2000-08-28,A gang lures a little boy into a washroom and chops off his penis.
"Key to the modern version of this ancient legend is the emasculation of a representative of one group by members of another. Fear of those who are seen to menace established society is expressed in graphic manner in this horrifying tale, with the fearful represented in the form of an innocent, helpless, angelic (and often blonde) child, and the feared portrayed as a powerful gang of mindlessly violent thugs. The set-upon child hasn't a chance against his attackers because they are many to his one, and they are also stronger and filled with hate. The person relating this legend as his way of sharing his growing anxiety at finding himself forced to co-exist with members of a minority that frightens him feels a similar sense of being outnumbered and threatened. He sees the empowerment of certain minorities or their encroachment into territory previously held to belong solely to his group as taking something vital from his power, hence the castration theme.",8,Mutilated Boy,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mutilated-boy/,legend,Did a gang lure a little boy into a washroom and chop off his penis?,Barbara Mikkelson,2000-08-28,A gang lures a little boy into a washroom and chops off his penis.
"Although this legend has traveled across the United States and England, and is always told as a ""this really happened!"" tale, all efforts to substantiate it have failed. Not so much as one instance of a boy being castrated in a washroom and left to die by a gang of folks of a different color or persuasion have surfaced although the rumor has run rampant through a number of communities, prompting various debunkers and police departments to expend great efforts to run it down.

"This ""mutilated boy"" legend shares commonalities with another common urban belief tale, the child kidnapped in an amusement park or store whose appearance is altered in the washroom to facilitate smuggling him out of that venue.

"On those true life occasions when a child was picked at random and murdered in a washroom (which has happened), it was invariably the work of a monster acting on his own, not the handiwork of a gang out to terrorize another group or to expend a child from another culture in a sick initiation rite.

In September 1998, Strohmeyer was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. This case caught the attention of a nation because at the time of the murder (approximately 4 am) Sherrice had been left unsupervised while her father gambled. At 1:33 am, hotel security officers noticed the little girl was unattended and paged for someone to collect her. Her 14-year-old brother claimed her, but soon left her alone again, according to casino officials, and she played in the arcade alone for the next two hours.

Your money or your life!"" The traveller, who was not easily frightened, immediately seizes his sword and gives him such a blow on the hand holding his horse that he cuts it clean off. Having done this, he spurs his horse and rides off so swiftly that he arrives home very soon after. His servant took his horse and led it to the stable; but when he came to unharness it, he noticed a hand hanging from the bridle, which gave him a nasty fright; surprised as he was, he dashed off into the house where, all a-tremble, he told him how he had found a severed hand still holding the horse's bridle. At first the master did not seem at all moved by his account, but after thinking about it for a while he recalled having hit out with his sword at a highwayman who had stopped his horse; whereupon he went to fetch the said hand, which he detached from the bridle with great difficulty and then nailed it on his front door as a trophy.",8,Severed Fingers,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/fingered-2/,legend,Motorist who has a run-in with ruffians afterwards find the severed fingers of his assailants on his car.,Barbara Mikkelson,2000-08-01,A motorist who has a run-in with ruffians afterwards finds the severed fingers of his assailants caught on his car.

Such a detail is used to prove that there's nothing new under the sun, that women have been vain to the point of risking serious harm in generations long past as well. The current interest in implants and tucks seems almost reasonable in light of such earlier practices.",10,Did Cher Have Ribs Removed To Make Her Waist Smaller?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/getting-waisted/,false,Did Cher have ribs removed to make her waist smaller?

"Wasp waists were considered the height of feminine glory, and many a Victorian gal measured her attractiveness by how small she could render this part of her anatomy. (Those wondering if they'd fit in should know the Victorian waistline is thought to have ranged from 18 to 32 inches.) The modifications, however, stopped short of surgery: One ate very little and wore tight corsets to get that effect.",11,Did Cher Have Ribs Removed To Make Her Waist Smaller?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/getting-waisted/,false,Did Cher have ribs removed to make her waist smaller?

"To believe the Victorian rib removal canard is to believe that in an age when even the most uncomplicated of surgeries often proved fatal, women were lining up to take the risk and surgeons were happily sawing away. Never mind that anesthesia was still an iffy proposition and that post-surgical death due to infection claimed a horrifying number, according to this falsehood the fair sex was willing to take ""suffer to be beautiful"" down to new lows.",12,Did Cher Have Ribs Removed To Make Her Waist Smaller?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/getting-waisted/,false,Did Cher have ribs removed to make her waist smaller?

"Valerie Steele, chief curator of The Museum at The Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City and an expert on corsets, says, ""No Victorians had ribs removed."" The size of a number of corsets from that era that are on display in ""The Corset: Fashioning the Body"" exhibit leads some to conclude there might have been something to that rib removal whisper after all, but the tiniest of the shapely 19th-century corsets were likely worn by young, thin women who were also small in stature. As well, upper-class children were required to wear corsets in the 18th and 19th centuries; those so appareled from childhood had their rib cages narrowed by these devices, accounting for some of these astonishingly small foundation garments.",13,Did Cher Have Ribs Removed To Make Her Waist Smaller?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/getting-waisted/,false,Did Cher have ribs removed to make her waist smaller?

"Corsets have come back into fashion again, with their rise in popularity spawning a growing industry to satisfy this fashion need. However, it's not only the ladies who wear this particular form of undergarment. One of the most famous corset-wearers of our time is male: Mr. Pearl has, through the use of corsetry, trained his waist from a measurement of 31 inches down to 18 inches. He admits to wearing his corset 24 hours a day, loosening it only for bathing. (Men wore tight corsets in the 19th century to give them a more military-appearing bearing under their uniforms and also to provide back support.)",14,Did Cher Have Ribs Removed To Make Her Waist Smaller?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/getting-waisted/,false,Did Cher have ribs removed to make her waist smaller?

"It's possible the rumor about women having ribs removed to make their waists smaller was deliberately started in the late 1890s by impresario Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr. (of the Ziegfeld Follies), who was then heavily engaged in generating publicity for Anna Held, an actress whose career he was directing. (The pair also had a relationship away from the footlights — they lived together from 1897 until 1909). Held was one of the beauties of her day and was celebrated for her 18 inch waist. To build interest in her (and so sell more tickets to her performances), Ziegfeld fed the press many a far-fetched tale about Held, including the laugher that she daily bathed in milk for its purported beneficial effects upon the skin. While it is not definitively known that he spread the tale about her having had rib removal surgery to achieve her famed wasp waist, it well fits with his abilities to work the press — he never seemed to regard any claims about any of his performers as too wild to feed to them, knowing that while they might scoff at some of the stories, they would repeat them in print and so add to the publicity being generated.",15,Did Cher Have Ribs Removed To Make Her Waist Smaller?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/getting-waisted/,false,Did Cher have ribs removed to make her waist smaller?

"Yet however the story began, it is and always has been a false one. While vanity has at times driven both sexes to commit horrendous excesses, having a few ribs taken out wasn't any of them. And the truth value of that statement does not alter when the name of a celebrity is tossed into the mix.",16,Did Cher Have Ribs Removed To Make Her Waist Smaller?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/getting-waisted/,false,Did Cher have ribs removed to make her waist smaller?

I didn't think much of it until now. The reason we were a little suspicious is we had been riding in a jeep all day with <NOBR>100 degrees</NOBR> temps and we stopped at a truck stop for something to drink. When I was leaving, a young girl followed me out and asked what kind of cologne I was wearing. Well, after <NOBR>7 hours</NOBR> in the car sweating, I don't think you could tell I was or was not wearing any cologne. We just got in the jeep and said no thanks. Then it was about 3 weeks ago, I was at a service station in Birmingham getting gas. It was about <NOBR>9:30 pm.</NOBR> I was approached by <NOBR>2 men</NOBR> and <NOBR>2 women</NOBR> in a car. The man that was driving asked me 'What kind of perfume do you wear?' I was a bit confused and I asked him 'Why?' He said, 'We are selling some name brand perfumes, at cheap prices.' I said I had no money. He then reached out of the car and handed me paper that was laminated; it had many perfumes on it. I looked quickly at it and gave it back. I said, I have no money. He said it is OK, we take check, cash, or credit cards. Then the people in the car began to laugh. I just got in my car and said no thanks. Then I received this e-mail yesterday and it sent chills up my spine. Please read this. It is no joke. Here is the <NOBR>e-mail</NOBR> I was sent. Dear Friends: I know not all of you are women that I am sending this to, but am hoping you will share this with your wives, daughters, mothers, sisters, etc. Our world seems to be getting crazier by the day. Pipe bombs in mailboxes and sickos in parking lots with perfume. Be careful. I was approached yesterday afternoon around <NOBR>5:30 PM</NOBR> in the Walmart parking lot by two males asking what kind of perfume I was wearing. Then they asked if I'd like to sample some fabulous scent they were willing to sell me at a very reasonable rate. I probably would have agreed had I not received an <NOBR>e-mail</NOBR> warning of a ""Wanna smell this neat perfume?"" scam. The men continued to stand between parked cars, I guess to wait for someone else to hit on. I stopped a lady going towards them, pointing at them and told her about how I was sent an <NOBR>e-mail</NOBR> at work about someone walking up to you at the malls or in parking lots and asking you to SNIFF PERFUME that they are selling at a cheap price. THIS IS NOT PERFUME...IT IS ETHER! When you sniff it, you'll pass out. They'll take your wallet, your valuables and heaven knows what else. If it were not for this e-mail, I probably would have sniffed the 'perfume' but thanks to the generosity of an <NOBR>e-mailing</NOBR> friend, I was spared whatever might have happened to me. I wanted to do the same for you. PLEASE PASS THIS ALONG TO ALL YOUR WOMEN FRIENDS AND PLEASE BE ALERT AND BE AWARE. IF YOU ARE A MAN AND RECEIVE THIS, PASS IT ON TO YOUR WOMEN FRIENDS. Ladies, this happened to me yesterday and I didn't smell the perfume either, thanks to this email. This is true. Believe me, I know. I was over by <NOBR>Big Lots</NOBR> in the parking lot at lunch time when I was approached. So either day or night, it does not matter. There were <NOBR>3 guys</NOBR> together when I was approached. I called the police when I got back to my desk. Like the email says above, LET EVERYONE KNOW ABOUT THIS - YOUR FRIENDS, FAMILY, CO-WORKERS, whomever. It helped me.

"The scenario described above isn't a real danger. No one has reported having been robbed in this manner, save for one woman in 1999 whose claim was suspect (for reasons we discuss below). This legend doesn't even describe a plausible scenario because, despite what books and television shows may depict, rendering a person unconscious from a mere sniff or two of some substance is not easy to do. Ether is nasty, volatile stuff that requires a great deal more than a few brief inhalations to knock a person out.

Ms. Johnson says she sniffed a sample of the cologne, and the next thing she knew it was around half an hour later, she was standing with her keys in her hand at a wicker store two miles away from the bank, her head was throbbing, and $800 she had been carrying ($500 of her own money plus $300 of her employer's) was missing.

"Wegmann was charged with second-degree battery and unlawful solicitation, but the battery charge has to do with forcing perfume samples upon unwilling parties, not because there was anything necessarily noxious in the substance she forced upon them.

"In 2001 a false Internet rumor about seven women having died after sniffing perfume samples sent to them in the mail spread in the wake of the September 11 attacks. This newer rumor was a combination of two older and equally baseless scares: the 1999 ""perfume robbers"" tale (which is the topic of the article above) and the 2000 Klingerman Virus warning about blue virus-laden sponges mailed in envelopes marked ""A gift for you from the Klingerman Foundation"" which supposedly caused 23 deaths. The 2001 ""deadly perfume samples"" rumor brought into play the specter of lurking terrorists using the U.S. mail system to murder the innocent in a women-targeted replay of the anthrax mailings horror. The ""deadly perfume samples"" rumor is distinct and indeed far removed from the ""perfume robbers"" one, yet folks are prone to confuse the two because they both use the word 'perfume.'",17,Are Robbers Subduing Victims with Perfume?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/perfume-robbers/,false,Long-standing crime warning holds that thieves are trolling parking lots and rendering their victims unconscious with perfume samples.,David Mikkelson,2000-06-12,Robbers in shopping mall parking lots are using ether-filled perfume bottles to render their victims unconscious.

"A man by the name of Jones purchased his dream car on October 17, 1989, a fancy red Porsche. It's what he always wanted. He drove off the lot and headed straight to the third game of the World's Series at Candlestick Park in Oakland, California [sic]. During that historic game, an incredible earthquake hit the city of San Francisco. The game was called off. People came running out of the stadium for their lives. Not only was the game canceled, but he went out there to his dismay, not only had an earthquake hit, but his car had been stolen, as well. A thief had taken his car. The car remained missing for several days as the police were preoccupied with the devastation of the earthquake. Finally they found his red Porsche. It was discovered underneath the collapsed Nimitz freeway. And the thief was still in it. He had died in the car he snatched.

Young Calvin's sockless exertions raised a blister on one of his toes, which soon became infected. The modern antibiotics that would quickly clear up such an infection today did not exist in 1924, and by the time White House physicians were summoned to treat Calvin Jr., it was too late: he died of pathogenic blood poisoning a week later.

"How this rumor began is something we can only guess at, and no obvious explanations spring to mind. Obviously the public knew that whatever killed Calvin had something to do with a wound on his foot and blood poisoning, so perhaps the sock rumor arose because it seemed like a logical explanation to those who were not privy to the details of his injury. Or perhaps, as Morgan and Tucker suggested in their book More Rumor!, it may simply have been ""the result of youthful anxiety about dress and appearance."" Either way, the claim may have seemed plausible at the time because some of the coloring agents commonly used by the clothing industry (such as zinc chloride, which was used to give socks a pearl gray color, and aniline dye, which was used to make shoe leather black) did indeed often cause serious inflammations when the unabsorbed chemicals came into contact with a wearer's skin.",4,Was Calvin Coolidge's Son Killed by His Socks?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/too-young-to-dye/,false,Did President Calvin Coolidge's son die from blood poisoning caused by the dye in his black socks?,David Mikkelson,2000-05-24,President Calvin Coolidge's son was killed by a poisonous dye in his black socks.

"Hotel invaders do exist, but their most effective means of gaining entrance to a victim's hotel room is to simply knock on the door and announce themselves as being from room service or maintenance. (Not surprisingly, even the savvy traveler will often unthinkingly open the door to a stranger under those circumstances.)

"Some hotels do provide ""hang on door"" breakfast menus which allow the room's occupant to check off desired items and indicate when the meal should be delivered. Such an arrangement can be a real timesaver, as anyone who has ordered breakfast from room service then sat around for an hour waiting for it can attest to.

Origins: In 1934 a particularly vicious rumor campaign aimed at disrupting sales of Chesterfield cigarettes went into effect. Up and down the Atlantic seaboard, then all across the U.S., the whispered tale was heard: ""A leper has been found working",1,Leper in Chesterfield Cigarette Factory,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-leper-who-changes-spots/,false,Was a leper found working in a Chesterfield cigarette factory?,Barbara Mikkelson,1999-12-17,A leper was found working in a Chesterfield cigarette factory.
"Fear of contracting leprosy through smoking product handled by a leper kept customers at bay. Liggett and Myers (the tobacco company which produced Chesterfields, among other brands), fought back by getting the mayor and the Board of Health of Richmond to issue an official statement that Chesterfield factories had been investigated and nothing had been found to support this rumor. The city officials said they could ""state with authority the malicious, malignant, underhanded and unfounded rumors pertaining to public health now being circulated ... are without the slightest foundation in fact and are lies made from whole cloth.""",2,Leper in Chesterfield Cigarette Factory,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-leper-who-changes-spots/,false,Was a leper found working in a Chesterfield cigarette factory?,Barbara Mikkelson,1999-12-17,A leper was found working in a Chesterfield cigarette factory.
"The announcement did little to slow the spread of the rumor. Like the work of the broom-wielding sweeper who follows the elephant, denials — even ones issuing from disinterested official sources — don't change the impression left by what the elephant dropped.",3,Leper in Chesterfield Cigarette Factory,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-leper-who-changes-spots/,false,Was a leper found working in a Chesterfield cigarette factory?,Barbara Mikkelson,1999-12-17,A leper was found working in a Chesterfield cigarette factory.
"Liggett and Myers also offered $1,000 rewards to the first 25 people who furnished them with satisfactory evidence as to who was spreading this tale. Though the company proved unsuccessful in tracing the story to its source, they did determine that the rumor appeared to be the work of professional rumormongers hired by

"stop on this wandering leper of lore's schedule. The company tried to duke it out with whoever was behind these tales, but that proved an exercise in boxing at

"The leper rumor wasn't the only image attack Liggett and Myers had to do battle with. Around the same time the ""leper"" rumor was circulating, the firm was combating false whispers that it had contributed more than half a million dollars to Adolf Hitler. They'd done no such thing, but the angered reaction raised in those who heard this rumor ran unchecked. Fear needs an outlet, and this rumor gave those concerned about Hitler's growing power a target for their apprehension:",6,Leper in Chesterfield Cigarette Factory,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-leper-who-changes-spots/,false,Was a leper found working in a Chesterfield cigarette factory?,Barbara Mikkelson,1999-12-17,A leper was found working in a Chesterfield cigarette factory.
"The untruth about Chesterfield's contributing to aid the Nazis at a time when many people lived in constant dread of Hitler's triumphs not only aroused a desire for revenge which resulted in fall-off of sales, but gave the gullible dupe personal satisfaction by providing him with a means for venting his own inner emotions. Condemning Chesterfield makers, spreading the rumor, and no longer buying the cigarettes became as pleasurable to the credulous as loosening the laces of a tight shoe or unfastening a belt buckle after a heavy dinner. It now became possible to manifest hatred for nazism, to take action against a frightening enemy by moving against an individual commercial group.

"Times change, but human nature doesn't.

"Recently, when visiting my parents in NJ, my elderly aunt told me that her neighbor's visiting nurse told her that another patient of hers was recovering from a snakebite. This woman had gone to a large clothing outlet type store and tried on a coat. After experiencing swelling and discomfort in her shoulder, went to the doctor who pronounced her the victim of an unknown snake. She returned to the store, found the same coat she had tried on and the store manager discovered two baby snakes still in residence in the coat.

Several summers ago a housewife in New York suffered a very unfortunate accident while out shopping. It transpired that she had gone into a large department store to look for a wicker clothes-basket with a lid. As she looked through the baskets she kept putting her hand inside the lid and running her fingers round the rim to check that they did not have any loose canes that would snag the clothes as they were pushed in and pulled out.,3,Was a Woman Fatally Bitten by a Snake in Her Coat Pocket?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/coat-of-armed/,legend,You never know when you may come across your worst fears.,Barbara Mikkelson,1999-12-03,A woman was fatally bitten by a snake found in the pocket of her new winter coat.
"While going through this procedure, all of a sudden, she gave a cry and fell to the floor. She was immediately rushed to hospital but found to be dead on arrival. On examination it was discovered that she had died as a result of a snake bite. When the baskets were checked they found a large and deadly poisonous snake in the bottom of the one she was seen to examine last. It was concluded that the snake had arrived in America having been shipped in the basket from the Far East.",4,Was a Woman Fatally Bitten by a Snake in Her Coat Pocket?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/coat-of-armed/,legend,You never know when you may come across your worst fears.,Barbara Mikkelson,1999-12-03,A woman was fatally bitten by a snake found in the pocket of her new winter coat.
"By 1991, a legend that had begun in the late 1960s as a ""snake hidden in most anything"" tale had polarized into a ""viper in a winter coat"" tale. Moreover, by that time the legend had come to be strongly associated with Burlington Coat Factory, a New Jersey firm with stores across the U.S.A. Though many clothiers manufacture outerwear, and winter coats are offered for sale in most clothing stores, Burlington Coat Factory is one of the few to specialize almost exclusively in this item of apparel. Consequently, any legend involving a winter coat will naturally gravitate towards that firm. The impression that coats are less expensive at Burlington adds to the believability of the legend — to sell them on the cheap, popular wisdom dictates that Burlington must be importing its inventory from third world countries just a'slithering with venomous snakes.",5,Was a Woman Fatally Bitten by a Snake in Her Coat Pocket?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/coat-of-armed/,legend,You never know when you may come across your worst fears.,Barbara Mikkelson,1999-12-03,A woman was fatally bitten by a snake found in the pocket of her new winter coat.
"Burlington says its been looking for that mythical snake for years and is constantly being asked about it.

"""If a snake is in there, it's got to sit in a distribution center for a few months before it's sent to the stores.

"Snake sightings in retail establishments are even more rare, but a 1991 lawsuit asserted that one slithered into a Pennsylvania couple's mattress. Shortly after purchasing the mattress in May 1988, the couple noted unusual movements in the bed that they suspected could be a living creature. They exchanged the mattress for another, but again noted those same odd movements in their bed. After four months of this, they took the mattress to a lab, where workers found what was left of a 26-inch ribbon snake.

"In September 2003, Douglas Hatchett of Bangs, Texas, while shopping for shoes in a Wal-Mart, claimed to have been bit by a rattlesnake which had been concealed behind a shoebox on a shelf. The victim said he stomped the snake to death, and the man was treated and released the same day from an area hospital. Doubt has since been expressed as to the veracity of his claim, with the hospital asserting Hatchett was not bitten by the snake and that their services were stolen by him. Wal-Mart as well is questioning the validity of Hatchett's story, and police at the scene said to a Wal-Mart employee the dead Western Diamondback rattler didn't look like a freshly killed snake.",9,Was a Woman Fatally Bitten by a Snake in Her Coat Pocket?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/coat-of-armed/,legend,You never know when you may come across your worst fears.,Barbara Mikkelson,1999-12-03,A woman was fatally bitten by a snake found in the pocket of her new winter coat.
"Key to understanding the legend is appreciating that the fatal coat is never purchased from an upscale shop. The common perception of discount stores' trading off quality for price enters into this legend, as does an element of the overly frugal shopper getting her just deserts. Had she only been willing to pay retail, we nod sagely to ourselves, she'd have lived.",10,Was a Woman Fatally Bitten by a Snake in Her Coat Pocket?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/coat-of-armed/,legend,You never know when you may come across your worst fears.,Barbara Mikkelson,1999-12-03,A woman was fatally bitten by a snake found in the pocket of her new winter coat.
"Most of all, however, this tale speaks to our fear of foreign contamination.

Hence stories circulate about alleged post-mortem discoveries that celebrities (such as John Wayne and Elvis Presley) who epitomized the ""meat and potatoes"" diet, gluttony, or other negative eating habits had some tremendous amount (40, 60, or even 80 pounds) of ""impacted fecal matter"" or ""impacted feces"" lodged in their",2,Red Meat Impacts Feces in Colon,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/meat-your-maker-2/,false,Did John Wayne's autopsy reveal 40 pounds of impacted feces in his colon?,David Mikkelson,1999-11-28,John Wayne's autopsy revealed 40 pounds of impacted fecal matter lodged in his colon.
"It is possible for fecal matter to become impacted and lodge in the digestive system. In most cases, the colon tissues eventually stretch so that stool can push its way around the impacted matter and be evacuated. If this condition continues too long, however, the colon can stretch to the point that its nerves are no longer capable of receiving signals effectively, and the afflicted person loses voluntary control over the contraction of his bowel muscles and becomes incontinent.",3,Red Meat Impacts Feces in Colon,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/meat-your-maker-2/,false,Did John Wayne's autopsy reveal 40 pounds of impacted feces in his colon?,David Mikkelson,1999-11-28,John Wayne's autopsy revealed 40 pounds of impacted fecal matter lodged in his colon.
"Now, think about how long a person would have to suffer with a serious and painful affliction such as this one to accumulate 80 pounds (or 60 pounds or 40 pounds) of ""impacted fecal matter."" In 1994, an Israeli man sought medical attention because he was suffering from severe constipation two days after having eaten a large quantity of pomegranates. He refused to allow doctors to adminster an enema, fled the hospital, and returned a week later in severe pain and bleeding from his rectum. This time the doctors operated to remove the impacted feces. How much fecal matter did they remove? Half a kilogram, or a little over a pound. Just one pound of impacted feces was causing extreme pain and rectal bleeding in this patient, but we're to believe that people can accumulate up to 80 pounds of the stuff without even being aware of it?",4,Red Meat Impacts Feces in Colon,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/meat-your-maker-2/,false,Did John Wayne's autopsy reveal 40 pounds of impacted feces in his colon?,David Mikkelson,1999-11-28,John Wayne's autopsy revealed 40 pounds of impacted fecal matter lodged in his colon.
"No matter what the medical possibilities might be, the prototypical John Wayne example is still a demonstrable lie: No autopsy was performed on John Wayne when he succumbed to cancer in 1979. The medical examiner's office had no reason to hold an autopsy since Wayne had obviously died from natural causes, and hospital pathologists had little to learn by requesting the autopsy of a cancer patient who had already undergone several major surgeries (and Wayne's family would have denied such a request in any case). In fact, Wayne's relatives were so intent on fending off a crush of media and fan attention after his death that they hired a security guard to block access to his hospital room, had his body quickly and secretly transferred to a mortuary, held a funeral service attended only by family and a few friends at 5:45 in the morning, and had him interred in a plot without a headstone. Nobody had the chance to perform an autopsy on John Wayne, much less to ""run his gut"" and weigh the amount of fecal material found within. (Wayne did undergo surgery for an intestinal blockage about a month before his death, but that blockage was caused by the spread of the cancer that was killing him, not by an accumulation of waste products.)",5,Red Meat Impacts Feces in Colon,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/meat-your-maker-2/,false,Did John Wayne's autopsy reveal 40 pounds of impacted feces in his colon?,David Mikkelson,1999-11-28,John Wayne's autopsy revealed 40 pounds of impacted fecal matter lodged in his colon.

"This account makes it sound like Elvis was a prime example of the hazards of the ""goo and glue"" diet, but his poor eating habits (greasy, cholesterol-laden foods such as cheeseburgers, french fries, bacon, fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches, ice cream) were far less responsible for the condition of his colon than other factors, such as his congenitally twisted ganglionic fold, his overuse of laxatives, and, primarily, his prolonged drug abuse. As one of the autopsy doctors described, ""When you take downer-type drugs, depressants, narcotics, a lot of them, most of them, have the concomitant effect of slowing down the digestive system. In other words, the locomotive action of the bowel quits working, so it gets packed with food, and then it gets packed with more food. And it sits there distended and full of food, and that causes the colon to stretch.""

"Dear Abby: I am 16 and am terrified to go to the mall. At our local shopping mall, crimes have been going on that are never reported in the newspaper because there are so many of them.

Stead was also a believer in mysticism and spiritualism who consulted mediums, investigated psychic phenomena, and published a related periodical.

They concocted yet another story that the look of terror and anguish in the face depicted on the coffin lid indicated that the coffin's original occupant was a tormented soul, and her evil spirit was now loose in the world. Stead and Murray told their fanciful tale to eager newspaper reporters who — then as now — weren't about to let the truth get in the way of a sensationally good story.

Stead was traveling to America at President Taft's request to address a peace conference, and he took delight in relating his ""cursed mummy"" tale to Titanic passengers.

"A few days after the Titanic's sinking, one of the survivors recounted Stead's ""cursed mummy"" tale in an interview with the New York World, and eventually the ghost story Stead and Murray invented, Stead's presence aboard the Titanic, and reports of Stead's having related the mummy tale to Titanic passengers became jumbled together, producing a new legend about an actual mummy aboard the Titanic.",13,Did a Cursed Mummy Sink with the Titanic?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mummy-titantic/,false,The ancient artifact that inspired this ghost story can still be seen at the British Museum.,Barbara Mikkelson,1999-10-09,The Titanic went to a watery grave carrying a cursed mummy in its hold.
"The modified legend told of a cursed mummy the British Museum was so anxious to be rid of that they sold it to an American, who naturally sought to ship it back home via the Titanic. The presence of the cursed mummy (which had escalated the expressions of its wrath from breaking cups and saucers and making people ill to sinking passenger liners) in the Titanic's hold came to be whispered as the cause of the most famous maritime disaster in history. In an even more elaborate version of the legend, the mummy's American owner paid a bribe to have the mummy placed in one of the Titanic's lifeboats; it was then smuggled aboard the Carpathia when that ship picked up the Titanic's survivors and secretly landed in New York.",14,Did a Cursed Mummy Sink with the Titanic?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mummy-titantic/,false,The ancient artifact that inspired this ghost story can still be seen at the British Museum.,Barbara Mikkelson,1999-10-09,The Titanic went to a watery grave carrying a cursed mummy in its hold.

"As to how widespread this ""curse of the mummy"" stuff is, some of the crew members on a failed 1980 expedition to locate the sunken Titanic spoke darkly of the famous mummy that was allegedly on board her, saying it transferred the curse of all who disturbed its grave to the vessel's maiden voyage and all subsequent search efforts.

They merely brought into play a standard avoidance technique employed to keep us from having to confront what a scary, random world this place can be. In the wake of any disaster, there's a strong urge to explain away the tragedy by ascribing it to some dark power beyond our control. As inconceivable as this might seem at first blush, it's easier for many people to accept that a cursed mummy was the cause of great loss of life than it is to co-exist with the knowledge that sometimes even unthinkable accidents will happen.

"At first blush it might appear reasonable that a dead man would have been left where he fell on a project this big, but structural integrity of the dam had to be maintained at all costs if it was to withstand pressure later.

The 'cold joints' created by this sectioning were very deliberately factored into the engineering plans of the structure. Each segment took hours to pour, with the wet concrete arriving in buckets containing roughly eight yards of concrete each.

"The ""coachman's warning"" legend has been kicking around since 1906 when it was told in Pall Mall Magazine as the E.F. Benson short story The Bus-Conductor. In that long-ago version, a man has the presaging encounter that saves his life through a disturbing late-night exchange with the driver of a hearse that pulls up to the home where he is staying as a houseguest. The hearse driver (who is puzzlingly dressed as a bus conductor) locks eyes with the man, gestures at his empty conveyance, and announces, ""Just room for one inside, sir."" A month later, that same unsettling man attempts to gesture the former houseguest into a bus he'd been planning to take, once again with ""Just room for one inside, sir."" The terrified man backs away then runs off. Moments later, the bus is struck from the side by a car traveling too fast, the automobile ""burrowing into it as a gimlet burrows into a board, making matchwood and — other things of it.""",1,Room for One More,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/room-for-one-more/,legend,Did a menacing dream about a creepy coachman save a woman's life?,Barbara Mikkelson,1999-09-19,A menacing dream prevents a woman from being killed in an accident.

It was a moonlit night, and she found it difficult to sleep. As the clock outside her bedroom door struck 12, she heard the noise of horses' hooves on the gravel outside, and the sound of wheels. She got up and went over to the window to see who could be arriving at that time of night. The moonlight was very bright, and she saw a hearse drive up to the door. It hadn't a coffin in it; instead it was crowded with people. The coachman sat high up on the box: as he came opposite the window he drew up and turned his head.

"It seems a motorcyclist was riding and wearing his jacket as he always did, backwards; this unorthodox method made the jacket more airtight and was more comfortable while riding.

"The official web site for The Blair Witch Project explains the mythology behind the Blair Witch legend that these students were supposedly investigating: In 1785, a woman accused of witchcraft is banished from the village of Blair, Maryland, and a year later, her accusers and half of Blair's children vanish. The town of Burkittsville is established at the site of the abandoned village about forty years later, and over the next 150 years a series of child murders and mutilations takes place. In 1994, three students decide to travel to Burkittsville to film interviews with locals about the Blair Witch legend as a class project, and a couple of days later they disappear in nearby woods. No trace of them is found until the footage they shot is discovered under an old cabin a year later.",1,The Blair Witch Project,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-blair-witch-hunt/,false,Is the film 'The Blair Witch Project' really a film shot by students who mysteriously disappeared?,David Mikkelson,1999-07-31,The movie The Blair Witch Project is based on footage shot by three student filmmakers who mysteriously disappeared while making a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch.
"First of all, the ""facts"" behind the Blair Witch legend are apocryphal. The rare 1809 book The Blair Witch Cult, which is ""commonly considered fiction"" and ""tells of an entire town cursed by an outcast witch,"" isn't real. (As the web site informs us, only one copy of the book exists, conveniently in the hands of an unnamed private collector.) A hermit who allegedly ""ritualistically murdered and disemboweled"" seven children in 1940-41 at the behest of ""an old woman ghost who occupied the woods near his house"" was ""quickly convicted and hanged,"" yet none of the area newspapers apparently saw fit to cover this sensational story. When the three student filmmakers allegedly disappeared in 1994, the Maryland State Police reportedly spent ten days and ""33,000 man hours"" employing dogs, helicopters, a hundred men, and even a ""fly over by a Department of Defense Satellite"" to locate them, but once again media coverage of this sensational, newsworthyevent was completely non-existent. (The citizens of Burkittsville and the Frederick County Sheriff's Department are happy to confirm the fictionality of these events.)",2,The Blair Witch Project,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-blair-witch-hunt/,false,Is the film 'The Blair Witch Project' really a film shot by students who mysteriously disappeared?,David Mikkelson,1999-07-31,The movie The Blair Witch Project is based on footage shot by three student filmmakers who mysteriously disappeared while making a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch.
"The legend of the Blair Witch was invented by the film's writer/directors, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez. Myrick and Sánchez hired three young actors (Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Joshua Leonard), explained the outline of the film's story to them, gave them advice about the characters they were to play, then turned them loose in the woods with film equipment to shoot movie footage. The actors received notes and supplies left for them and carried a Global Positioning System (GPS) device with them for tracking purposes, but they didn't know exactly what was going to happen once they embarked on their movie-making venture — thus the film has the feel of a documentary that captures events genuinely surprising to the filmmakers. (If you're still convinced the movie's premise is real, perhaps the fact that the ""dead"" film students are giving interviews — such as the one in Salon — will dissuade you.) Adding to the movie's pre-release build-up was the airing on the Sci-Fi Channel of a fictional documentary, The Curse of the Blair Witch, about the putative Blair Witch legend and the making of the related film. (Remember, the ""Fi"" in ""Sci-Fi"" stands for fiction.)",3,The Blair Witch Project,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-blair-witch-hunt/,false,Is the film 'The Blair Witch Project' really a film shot by students who mysteriously disappeared?,David Mikkelson,1999-07-31,The movie The Blair Witch Project is based on footage shot by three student filmmakers who mysteriously disappeared while making a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch.

Though she'd previously asked for a divorce, she'd never mentioned her relationship with Glover. The news in her diary came as a shock to Schap; upon her return he asked her pointblank if she'd been sleeping with his friend.

"versions of this story often place it at the West Edmonton Mall in Canada or the Mall of America in the United States. In those incarnations the action supposedly takes place in the parking lot, where a Good Samaritan places the deceased beastie in a shopping bag, then retreats to her own car to watch so she'll be on hand to give an explanation when the cat's owner returns. Another woman comes along, filches the bag, and gets it back to her own car, where she opens it and is seen fainting dead away once she catches sight of her ill-gotten gains.

"Through the association of ideas, a given concept turns into a dramatic event, such as the perennial wonder of the Dead-Cat-Come-to-Justice. A New York City newspaperman once decided to track down this tale. He had first heard it from a friend. Claiming to believe the story himself, the friend told the newspaperman about a woman who had placed her pet cat in a veterinary hospital where it later died. As she wished to give the animal a decent burial, the woman called for her pet's remains; and neatly wrapped in a box she received the dead cat. Along the way home, the woman stopped to do some shopping at Stern's department store on 42nd Street. While selecting her purchases, the woman placed the box on a near-by counter. But suddenly she looked around for it, and the box was gone. Stern's detectives began searching the store for the packaged body of the cat. Within a short time they found it. The opened box, the deceased animal leering out of it, was on the floor of a telephone booth. Alongside there lay the body of a woman, immediately identified as a well-known shoplifter who had been under the scrutiny of this and other stores for several months. The shoplifter had apparently taken her loot to the telephone booth, opened it, caught a glimpse of the dead cat, and dropped to the floor dead of a heart attack resulting from fright. His friend, the newspaperman learned, got the rumor about this macabre justice from two actors who lived in the neighboring apartment. The two knew the full truth of the story, according to the friend. Yet, interviewing the actors, the journalist found they had received the tale from a Christian Science practitioner, a man whose word they did not doubt as he had told them the rumor as gospel. The Christian Science practitioner willingly repeated this gospel before the newspaperman, adding that he had heard it from a woman. She was the friend of the dead cat's owner. She would give him the names of all the people involved. And, to be sure, this woman was full of the dead-cat wonder, according to thejournalist . . . Not that she actually knew the name of the animal's owner. But she had heard the rumor from her son-in-law, who knew all about it. ""He turned out to know everything about it,"" the newspaperman reported. ""He had heard the story firsthand from a passenger on a commuters' train whose aunt knew the lady who owned the dead cat."" Still curious about the rumor, the newspaperman went to Stern's department store. There a somewhat firm, if not angered, chief detective swiftly assured him that nothing of the sort had happened. Neither had the local police station any record of either a dead shoplifter or a dead cat having been reported. While the newspaperman was playing ring-around-a-rosy with the Dead-Cat-Come-to-Justice rumor, it was having a gay time of its own. It was flying from table to table, from office to office on its cross-country journey. Readjusted to fit the local situation in Chicago, the rumor was an eye-opener, months later, when it became current talk. In California, the following year, people gasped in amazement as they heard about the fate of the shoplifter in the local department store. And at least one national magazine published the rumor as one of its truth-is-stranger-than-fiction features for the edification of the wonder-lovers among its loyal subscribers.",4,The Dead Cat in the Package,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-dead-cat-in-the-package/,legend,Thief makes off with a package containing a dead cat.,Barbara Mikkelson,1999-07-28,A package containing a dead cat is stolen by a thief who thinks she's making off with something of value.

"Dear Abby: I just received a letter from my daughter, Kathy, who is attending school in Provo, Utah.

She wanted a really nice tan for the trip, so last week she went to a tanning parlor. She'd never been to one before, so she asked how long was the maximum time she could stay in, and they said half an hour. Well, she wanted a really dark tan, fast, so she went to seven places and spent a half-hour in each — three and a half hours total! Well, this poor girl is now in Utah Valley Regional Medical Center. They estimate she has about 26 days to live. She's totally blind, and they say it's as if she had 'microwaved' herself — it's basically the same principle.

Legend has it when he told his fellows he had seen heaven and hell, he was promptly dispatched and re-interred on grounds of heresy. And the 13th-century Thomas a Kempis, the reputed author of the great devotional work The Imitation of Christ, was never made a saint because, it was said, when they dug up his body for the ossuary they found scratch marks on the lid of his coffin and concluded that he was not reconciled to his fate.",3,Have People Been Buried Alive?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/just-dying-to-get-out/,true,And could it still happen?,Barbara Mikkelson,1999-06-09,People have been buried alive by mistake.

"Okay, so it was (and still is) possible to be buried alive or to meet your maker on a post-mortem table. The prospect is chilling, and numerous people have gone to great lengths to make sure it doesn't happen to them. The practice of 'waking' the dead (having someone sit with the deceased from the time of death until burial in case he 'wakes up') began out of this concern. Especially in bygone days when a number of illnesses could cause the sufferer to slip into a coma and thus make it appear all life functions had been snuffed out, the danger of overly hasty interment was real.

"The screams of a young Belgian girl who came out of a trance-like state as the earth fell on her coffin so upset Count Karnice-Karnicki, Chamberlain to the Czar and Doctor of the Law Faculty of the University of Louvain, that he invented a coffin which allowed a person accidentally buried alive to summon help through a system of flags and bells. Patented in 1897, this hermetically-sealed coffin had a tube, about 3.5 inches in diameter, extending to a box on the surface. The tube was attached to a spring-loaded ball sitting on the corpse's chest. Any movement of the chest would release the spring, opening the box lid and admitting light and air into the coffin.

Because she was a world renowned figure and there was some fear of thievery, a guard was hired to stay with the body until it was interred and the tomb sealed, and a telephone was installed at the receiving vault for his use during that period.

"A group of medical students were bored and so they tried to think of ways of livening things up. Eventually one had the idea of ""borrowing"" a human foot from the dissecting laboratory and putting it in his girlfriend's bed as a joke.

"There are numerous ""cadaver parts and medical students"" legends in existence, with the typical plot of them being a corpse or its parts are shanghaied by a medical student (possibly with the help of his buddies) and used to scare the bejeezus out of people. Undoubtedly, some of these stories are true and the events as described did indeed happen at least a couple of times. However, it should be pointed out that most of these stories have long since passed into the realm of lore, with each new class of medical students being told this prank or that was played out right in this very medical school just last term. Some of the more common of these tales are:",8,Woman Goes Insane After Finding Body Part in Bed,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/arm-stammer/,legend,A girl goes insane after a medical student slips a cadaver's arm into her bed as a practical joke.,Barbara Mikkelson,1999-05-02,A girl goes insane after a medical student slips a cadaver's arm into her bed as a practical joke.
"There are reasons for these tales — they play an important role in the metamorphosis of medical students into doctors. The activities as described in cadaver stories represent a way for the student to prove he's triumphed over the cadaver, the confrontation and dissection of which we can imagine must have caused him no small grief. These legends also define medical students as a group apart from the rest in that they've had to handle dead bodies and parts thereof, and this has helped to foster in them the necessary emotional detachment for when they advance to doing the same things to living people. The boundaries between medical students and non-medical students are thus drawn, with the medical students choosing to self-define as emotionally tough and perhaps even a bit callous in the face of the demise of others. They exult in their detachment, celebrating it as proof they were meant to be doctors.",9,Woman Goes Insane After Finding Body Part in Bed,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/arm-stammer/,legend,A girl goes insane after a medical student slips a cadaver's arm into her bed as a practical joke.,Barbara Mikkelson,1999-05-02,A girl goes insane after a medical student slips a cadaver's arm into her bed as a practical joke.
"There's also an element of ""whistling through the graveyard"" in that fellow medical students are expected to laugh at these stories as a way of showing they are not now afraid of going hands on with mortality even if they're still quaking in their boots inwardly at the thought of touching the dead. The ability to find humor in the macabre is a way of (superficially at least) proving oneself tough enough to last in the medical profession. Failure to laugh at these stories is to risk being seen as a wimp by the rest of the group. Note that the same story told to outsiders is expected to prompt reactions of shock and disgust, further defining the difference between being a member of ""us"" and being one of ""them.""",10,Woman Goes Insane After Finding Body Part in Bed,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/arm-stammer/,legend,A girl goes insane after a medical student slips a cadaver's arm into her bed as a practical joke.,Barbara Mikkelson,1999-05-02,A girl goes insane after a medical student slips a cadaver's arm into her bed as a practical joke.
"A young lady on her way home in her 4 by 4 from an evening out approaches a set of traffic lights in a deserted area and sees the body of a man lying in the middle of the junction. Realising that hi-jackers often use this ruse to lure their unsuspecting victims out of their cars the young lady drives off the road and into the adjoining veld (overgrown wasteland) and skirts around the junction and the prostrate form. She drives to the local police station to report the incident (just in case the lifeless form is genuine). The police escort her back to the scene where there is no sign of the man who was lying in the road. However, after a little further investigation the police discover the dead bodies of 3 (or 4) armed men in the veld where they had been lying in wait for her to stop the vehicle. She had ridden over them when she took her detour around the ""body"".

"A woman was driving home one night (in her 4 wheel drive vehicle) along a remote road outside Johannesburg, an area where numerous car-jackings had taken place. Ahead of her she saw an abandoned car parked across the middle of the narrow road. Fully aware of the danger of stopping, or even slowing down, she pushed her foot down on the accelerator, and drove off the road, along the bumpy grass shoulder, and back onto the road when she had passed the car. When she got home she phoned the police, reported the suspicious vehicle and went to bed.",2,Carjacking Irony,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/carjack-and-jilted/,legend,"A driver foils an attempted carjacking by ignoring a 'body' lying on the road, then inadvertently kills her four would-be attackers.",Barbara Mikkelson,1999-04-29,"A lone driver spots a ""body"" lying on the road but takes a detour around it instead of stopping to investigate.

It then transpired that in doing so she had driven over and killed the three men who were lying in wait to ambush her.

"Any carjacking legend that has the intended victim not only foiling the attempt but also doing in a couple of the bad guys is going to find a very receptive audience in South Africa. Within the last decade, violent crime has become a fact of life in that country, with vicious carjackings suddenly almost an everyday occurrence even in the best neighborhoods. Many South Africans — black and white — will not now venture out of their homes without a gun. For good reason too: In 1997 the boys with the calculators worked out that every week in South Africa there were 434 murders, 7,210 thefts, 1,218 armed robberies and 952 rapes. That's nothing to sneeze at, considering there are only 40.5 million people in the whole country. To put these numbers in better perspective, South Africa's 1997 murder rate was 52 people per 100,000, compared with a U.S. rate of 6.8 the same year.",4,Carjacking Irony,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/carjack-and-jilted/,legend,"A driver foils an attempted carjacking by ignoring a 'body' lying on the road, then inadvertently kills her four would-be attackers.",Barbara Mikkelson,1999-04-29,"A lone driver spots a ""body"" lying on the road but takes a detour around it instead of stopping to investigate. She later discovers she made the right choice — she'd driven over the four men lying in wait for her."
"Armed carjacking occurs on an all too frequent basis, taking place mainly in relatively populated areas: at traffic lights and stop signs, in parking lots, and in the driveways of homes. In the first eleven months of 1998, there were 13,000 carjackings. Fewer than one in ten carjacking cases ends up in court, and only one in fifty ends in a conviction. Moreover, people end up dead over this.",5,Carjacking Irony,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/carjack-and-jilted/,legend,"A driver foils an attempted carjacking by ignoring a 'body' lying on the road, then inadvertently kills her four would-be attackers.",Barbara Mikkelson,1999-04-29,"A lone driver spots a ""body"" lying on the road but takes a detour around it instead of stopping to investigate.

"South Africans are fighting back. As the problems worsened and more temperate responses failed to have appreciable effect (educating drivers about how to spot trouble and avoid confrontations, installing conventional anti-theft devices on vehicles), more drastic measures have taken their place. In 1999, it's possible to get your car equipped with the latest in personal security weapons — a driver-operated flamethrower called The Blaster.",6,Carjacking Irony,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/carjack-and-jilted/,legend,"A driver foils an attempted carjacking by ignoring a 'body' lying on the road, then inadvertently kills her four would-be attackers.",Barbara Mikkelson,1999-04-29,"A lone driver spots a ""body"" lying on the road but takes a detour around it instead of stopping to investigate.

"That might sound like overkill, but consider this: conventional solutions have failed badly, often only working to escalate the danger to drivers. South Africa used to be a nation plagued by run-of-the-mill auto thefts in which cars were made off with while their owners were elsewhere. As auto theft statistics began to soar, owners invested in more and more sophisticated security devices. The most popular of these was the high-tech ""immobilizer"" which ensures the starter motor will accept only the original key.",7,Carjacking Irony,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/carjack-and-jilted/,legend,"A driver foils an attempted carjacking by ignoring a 'body' lying on the road, then inadvertently kills her four would-be attackers.",Barbara Mikkelson,1999-04-29,"A lone driver spots a ""body"" lying on the road but takes a detour around it instead of stopping to investigate. She later discovers she made the right choice — she'd driven over the four men lying in wait for her."
"The security people got smarter. They patented a device which could neutralize the engine by remote control from a distance of several kilometers. The idea was that a driver could allow the thief to drive off with the vehicle and then ""immobilize"" it from a safe distance.",8,Carjacking Irony,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/carjack-and-jilted/,legend,"A driver foils an attempted carjacking by ignoring a 'body' lying on the road, then inadvertently kills her four would-be attackers.",Barbara Mikkelson,1999-04-29,"A lone driver spots a ""body"" lying on the road but takes a detour around it instead of stopping to investigate.

"Over the years, the advice given to South African drivers hasn't been much more effective at preventing carjackings than the non-aggressive security devices mentioned above. A 1995 article suggested ramming the car in front of you at an intersection if someone attempted to carjack your vehicle. (No, I've no idea what good that would do either.) A 1997 article gave the following advice for avoiding becoming a carjack statistic in South Africa. In short: Don't drive, and don't own a car. And if you must do either, then be prepared to never relax your vigilance.",9,Carjacking Irony,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/carjack-and-jilted/,legend,"A driver foils an attempted carjacking by ignoring a 'body' lying on the road, then inadvertently kills her four would-be attackers.",Barbara Mikkelson,1999-04-29,"A lone driver spots a ""body"" lying on the road but takes a detour around it instead of stopping to investigate. She later discovers she made the right choice — she'd driven over the four men lying in wait for her."
"Now that you're a little better acquainted with the carjacking situation in South Africa, you probably better understand the delight often expressed over this legend. Ordinary citizens are ending up hurt, maimed, or dead simply because they own cars someone else wants to sell for parts. That one of those ordinary citizens could not only escape unharmed but in the process kill off three or four of these murderers is seen as nothing but justice come at last.",10,Carjacking Irony,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/carjack-and-jilted/,legend,"A driver foils an attempted carjacking by ignoring a 'body' lying on the road, then inadvertently kills her four would-be attackers.",Barbara Mikkelson,1999-04-29,"A lone driver spots a ""body"" lying on the road but takes a detour around it instead of stopping to investigate.

"How ripe small towns actually are for rumors was amply demonstrated a few years ago. In a town of thirteen thousand inhabitants, which was gradually blossoming into cityhood, there was a restaurant operated by three Chinese. It was the most successful eating place around, patronized by businessmen and citizens morning, noon, and night. Everyone agreed that the food and service were good. But without the slightest warning business suddenly took a drastic drop. The once-prosperous proprietors became miserably unhappy, for they could not understand what had happened to all their patrons. Then they found out that someone, maybe a competitor, maybe just a person who nursed a real or imagined grudge against Chinese, had initiated a rumor that the police had found three skinned cats, labeled rabbits, in the restaurant's refrigerator.",2,Cat in Chinese Food,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cat-chinese-food/,false,Do Chinese restaurants serve cat meat?,Barbara Mikkelson,1999-04-29,Chinese restaurants in the U.S. use cat meat in their entrees.

"As an example (this rumor has turned up in so many cities, it would be impossible to list them all), in 1995 the closing of two Chinese restaurants in Columbus, Ohio, awakened the sleeping rumor yet again. Calls were fielded, both by the local paper and the board of health, about whispers that these closings were the result of dead cats' being discovered in each eatery's meat locker.

"In 1991, after a Burlington, Ontario [Canada] Chinese eatery lost 30% of its trade to this rumor, its owners attempted to combat the talk by inviting the local professional football team, the Hamilton Ti-Cats, to eat there on the house. Due to the loss of business, restaurant staff had seen their work week cut by 10 hours. The trouble had started two months earlier, with its first sign being a phone call from a woman asking if the restaurant was closed. A friend had told her health officials had padlocked the 434-seat restaurant because it ""had been serving cat."" That call was the first of many to the restaurant, the health department, and the media. Callers often said others told them the rumor was on radio or in the papers, but no such reports had been broadcast or published.

"This legend is a classic example of xenophobia (fear and hatred of foreigners or that which is foreign). Asian culture is markedly different from Western culture, with language but the first barrier to be hurdled. Customs, religious observances, traditions — all are wildly different from their North American counterparts. As with all xenophobic reactions, that which isn't the same is vilified. The Asian culinary practice of making a tiny bit of meat stretch to feed a family by cutting it up fine and making it part of a larger dish of vegetables or noodles is transformed by fear into a vehicle for ""them"" to slip something objectionable into our unwitting stomachs. Likewise, that the Chinese don't as a rule keep cats and dogs as pets becomes seen as a willingness to plop someone else's animal companion into the stew pot.

"Though the Chinese have been known to dine on cats or dogs in their homeland, the practice is predominant primarily in far-flung regions, and they don't serve them up on unsuspecting diners in Europe or North America, where these animals are known to enjoy the exalted status of family pets. It is true that dog is more or less routinely consumed in Korea, where it's seen as a game meat, but even there Western sensibilities are catered to on this issue. When the Olympics were held in Seoul in 1988, every wire service ran stories about dog being one of the dishes that could be ordered in a restaurant there. In response, the South Korean government temporarily shut down more than 400 eateries where dog soup was a staple. It knew visiting cultures would never understand.

"Hello, my name is Tina Strongman and I work at a police station, as a phone operator for 911. Lately, we've received many phone calls pertaining to a new sort of problem that has arisen in the inner cities, and is now working it's way to smaller towns. It seems that a new form of gang initiation is to go find as many pay phones as possible and put a mixture of LSD and Strychnine onto the buttons. This mixture is deadly to the human touch, and apparently, this has killed some people on the east coast. Strychnine is a chemical used in rat poison and is easily separated from the rest of the chemicals.

"attack on American society being waged by gang members and drug addicts hasn't fared as well as they'd hoped, so now they've joined forces in yet another scheme: spreading a deadly mixture of strychnine and LSD on pay phone buttons.

"We all know the drill: a ""important"" warning message from a source who is named but might as well be anonymous, since she provides no details or contact information (not even the name of a city). Said person claims to know that this problem has ""arisen in the inner cities, and is now working it's [sic] way to smaller towns"" even though this is the first anyone else has heard of it, and tells us that this nefarious trap ""has killed some people on the east coast"" although no reports of any such deaths have made the news. And as a ""gang initiation ritual,"" this one is pretty lame. Gang initiations are supposed to provide prospective members with the opportunity to prove their worthiness by demonstrating their courage and bravery.

"(The effectiveness of this scheme is dubious as well — if the victim didn't come along immediately after the application of the deadly mixture, he'd probably have to have sweaty hands or hold his finger to a button for several minutes, since momentary contact with the dried product would likely have no effect.

"The mention of strychnine and LSD was a deft touch. Strychnine and LSD have long been associated with each other, through beliefs that strychnine is a by-product or contaminant resulting from the production of LSD, that some drug users add strychnine to their LSD because it produces a better experience, that drug sellers use strychnine to make LSD bond to blotter paper more efficiently, or that unscrupulous drug dealers cut costs by mixing strychnine with the LSD they sell.

The children had been put to bed and the baby-sitter was watching the television when the phone rang. She answered but all she heard was a man laughing hysterically and then a voice saying, ""I'm upstairs with the children, you'd better come up."" Thinking it was ""one of those phone calls"" or a practical joke she slammed down the receiver and turned the television sound up. A short time later the phone rang again and, as she picked it up, the unmistakable hysterical laughter came down the line and the voice once again said ""I'm upstairs with the children, you'd better come up.""",1,The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-babysitter-and-the-man-upstairs/,legend,"A babysitter receives mysterious, threatening phone calls.",David Mikkelson,1999-03-29,"A babysitter left alone in charge of sleeping children receives several mysterious, threatening phone calls."

"Origins: Such are the times that it's actually refreshing to see a new horror legend that doesn't involve needles, AIDS, drugs, gangs or abducted women — just an old-fashioned random serial killer who doesn't need a murder weapon other than his own two",2,Balcony Deaths,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-trip/,false,Stranger trips young girls and sends them plummeting over theater balconies?,David Mikkelson,1999-03-15,Young girls are tripped by a stranger and sent plummeting to their deaths from theater balconies.
"What this legend does share with most others of its ilk is the setting. Describing the random, senseless deaths of victims who are killed while at the site of a pleasurable activity (fishing hole, amusement park, movie theater, dance club, golf club) is a staple of horror legends. In this case the death is neither an unintentional one caused by an accident or a non-human agent (such as the recent legend about snakes in ball pits) or one with a deliberate purpose beyond mere senseless killing (such as a the gang initation ritual found in the resurgent legend about headlight flashing). Here we have a stranger who kills or maims young women in movie theaters for no apparent reason other than the thrill of it all.",3,Balcony Deaths,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-trip/,false,Stranger trips young girls and sends them plummeting over theater balconies?,David Mikkelson,1999-03-15,Young girls are tripped by a stranger and sent plummeting to their deaths from theater balconies.

What's not included, of course, are the usual verifiable details: dates, names of cities, names of victims, names of police contacts, etc.",4,Balcony Deaths,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-trip/,false,Stranger trips young girls and sends them plummeting over theater balconies?,David Mikkelson,1999-03-15,Young girls are tripped by a stranger and sent plummeting to their deaths from theater balconies.
"Since the message claims three different occurrences of girls' being attacked in movie theaters by someone with the same modus operandi (but no mention of this being a gang initiation rite), we can probably assume the crimes are the work of a single man. If so, why he is still on the loose? At the very least, why don't we have a description of him? In all three cases only one of a pair of girls was killed or injured; the other surely saw the monster pull off his crime and described it to someone, or else we wouldn't know the details: that the murderer pretended to be asleep, sat two seats from the aisle, ""woke up"" when the sound check played, ""accidentally"" spilled his drink, and finally deliberately tripped one of the girls to send her hurtling off the balcony. The criminal couldn't have escaped too quickly for anyone to see him, as he would have had to climb over or around at least some theater seats (and possibly other patrons) to effect his escape. The theater lights may have been turned down for the beginning of the program, but movie theaters aren't so dark that you couldn't at least observe the height, clothing, and general features of another person standing right in front of you (and it apparently wasn't too dark to notice that the man deliberately tripped his victims).

"Geologists working somewhere in remote Siberia had drilled a hole some 14.4 kilometers deep (about 9 miles) when the drill bit suddenly began to rotate wildly. A Mr. Azzacov (identified as the project's manager) was quoted as saying they decided that the center of the earth was hollow. Supposedly, the geologists measured temperatures of over 2,000 degrees in the deep hole.

A Norwegian schoolteacher visiting California heard that broadcast and took the story back to Norway with him. He then mailed it to a Christian magazine in Finland.

"Harrisburg, Pa. (AP) — A man whose wife weighed twice as much as he did was squashed to death when she sat on him during a domestic quarrel, the Dauphin County coroner said Thursday. Kay Weaver, 36, sat on her husband Kenneth, 41, for five to ten minutes in their rural home in nearby Elizabethville, said Dr. William B. Bush, the county coroner. ""The massive amount of pressure on his chest rendered him unable to breathe,"" said Bush, whose office conducted an autopsy and investigation. ""Because of that, he suffocated."" State trooper Claude Mohr, who investigated the case, said Mrs. Weaver weighs about 280 pounds. Bush said the woman's husband was a ""very small, very thin"" man, weighing between 125 and 140 pounds. Mrs. Weaver was not in custody and will probably not be charged, the trooper said. ""She was trying to restrain her husband,"" Mohr said. ""There's no indication there was any foul play intended."" Weaver came home drunk and in a bad mood at about 4 p.m. Tuesday, Mohr said. He soon went out again to go drinking and returned about 9 p.m. after running his truck into a ditch, the trooper said. After Weaver ""threatened to shoot the wife and two sons and burn the house down,"" his wife attempted to subdue him while a son was sent to get the state police, Mohr said.

The train was going too fast for there to be time to get the children off. So they all died. When we finally found the tracks, we stopped the car, parking it right on the railroad tracks. We were both a little nervous, and scared, and waited for something to happen. Just when we were about to leave, the car started rolling. We were both too freaked out to do any more than grab each other and gasp, eyes wide, mouths open. After what seemed like an eternity, (but was actually less than 5 minutes tops) the car stopped rolling. We looked around, and we were off the railroad tracks. Now, that may not seem spooky, but what we saw next scared us enough to jump back in the car and make the 6 hour trip home THAT NIGHT. Both of us got out of the car and walked around to the back.

That doesn't mean it couldn't or hasn't happened, but such an infestation would be limited to soft tissue around the outer ear.

Trying to remove the beetle only pushed it in further.

This young couple is out parked on a country road. The girl is real nervous and uneasy. It seems that there had been a report about an escaped criminal in the area. He was supposed to be dangerous, a mad killer. They called him ""The Hook"" because one of his hands was missing and he wore a hook in place of it. He was supposed to have used it on all of his victims. Anyway, the girl was real uneasy for some reason. Supposedly, they were not aware of the escaped killer. She kept saying she had an uneasy feeling but she did not know why. The guy finally got mad at her. He thought she was just making up excuses because she didn't want to park. Finally he lost his temper and stepped on the gas. He really tore out of there fast. He didn't say a word on the way home.

This behavior is essential to explain how the hook became ripped from the killer's arm, and to underscore the moral of the tale. The boyfriend's frustration stems from sexual denial.

"McDowell immediately called over the manager who denied the allegations, so she contacted the local health department. They sent the ""mayo"" remains off for testing and the results were positive for 2 different types of semen. To make matters worse, in the following days, McDowell woke with a giant red rash on the corner of her mouth. The rash spread and developed into severe blisters. The doctor was able to verify that she had contracted the herpes virus, which she claims was a result of her tainted McChicken.
The manager confirmed that two employees were fired as a result of her allegations and the positive semen test results.

"This twisted tale was born on Thursday, 18 May 1967, when California newspapers began reporting a horrific tale concerning some Santa Barbara college students who damaged their eyes by staring at the sun while they were under the influence of LSD.

"FROM SUN GAZING WHILE ON 'TRIP' Four LSD Users Suffer Serious Eye Damage Exclusive to The Times from a Staff Writer SANTA BARBARA — Four college students have suffered permanent impairment of vision as a result of staring at the sun while under the influence of LSD, according to a spokesman for the Santa Barbara Ophthalmological Society. One of the youths told his doctor he was ""holding a religious conversation with the sun."" Another said he had gazed at the sun ""to produce unusual visual displays."" The students, all males, suffered damage to the retina, the sensory membrane which receives the image formed by the lens. In the same way that a piece of paper will burn when bright light is beamed through a magnifying glass, a pinhead-size hole was burned into the retina of each eye of the students as sunlight passed through the lens. What this has left the students with is not total blindness but a blind spot in the center of their vision. As a result, the victims have lost their reading vision completely and forever, the ophthalmological spokesman said. ""For example, if you wanted to read,"" he said, ""you might see all of the corners of the page and most of the print — except you wouldn't be able to see that one word you were looking at. ""If you were to look at a traffic stoplight, you might see the pole and trees and cars — but you wouldn't see the stoplight itself. ""That little black hole always moves directly where you want to see,"" he said. Solar burns of the retina, the spokesman said, are not uncommon, particularly among children watching eclipses of the sun. But he knew of no previous cases which resulted from someone being under the influence of LSD. In the cases here, the victims admitted they were users of LSD. Three of them attend UC Santa Barbara, the other goes to Santa Barbara City College. Their ages range from 18 to 24. The spokesman said it was his impression that each of the sun-staring incidents occurred separately. He did not know whether the students knew each other. The four had no awareness of pain or discomfort while the sun was burning through the eye tissue, the spokesman said. The damage is permanent, because tissue so damaged does not regenerate itself.",2,LSD Users Stare at Sun,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/blinded-by-the-light/,false,College students tripping on LSD stared at the sun until they went blind?,David Mikkelson,1998-11-03,Several students tripping on LSD stared at the sun until blinded.

"6 College Men Take LSD, Blinded by Sun WASHINGTON (AP) — Six college men suffered total and permanent blindness by staring at the sun while under the influence of the drug LSD, it was learned Friday. The six, all juniors at a western Pennsylvania college that officials decline to name, lost their sight after they took the hallucinatory drug together last spring. Norman M. Yoder, commissioner of the Office of the Blind in the Pennsylvania State Welfare Department, said the retinal areas of the youths' eyes were destroyed. Federal officials questioned about the case said it is the first they have heard of in which total blindness resulted. The only similar case officials knew of was one reported last May in which four students at the University of California at Santa Barbara suffered permanent loss of their reading vision by staring at the sun after taking LSD. Lie on backs in Sun Yoder said in a telephone interview from Harrisburg that the Pennsylvania students all had taken LSD at least once before. He said they went to a grassy area in a woodland about half a mile from the college and took the drug there. Then, he said, they all lay on their backs in the grass ""and were not consciously looking at the sun."" The youths were found at the scene, blind and helpless, the afternoon of the same day by fellow students who knew of the ""trip"" plans. Those using the drug had been gone about six hours. Yoder said the youths didn't even realize they were staring at the sun ""until they came out of the trance,"" but that they had come to their senses when the other students arrived. The afflicted students have since been receiving rehabilitation services of the Pennsylvania Welfare Department.",6,LSD Users Stare at Sun,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/blinded-by-the-light/,false,College students tripping on LSD stared at the sun until they went blind?,David Mikkelson,1998-11-03,Several students tripping on LSD stared at the sun until blinded.

"First of all, notice that the ante has been upped: now there are six students; the victims have been made completely blind; and, as Newsweek described it, this tragedly befell engineering students who were ""nice kids, not hippies"" (unlike those California freaks who blathered on about having ""religious conversations with the sun""). And once again, there's that nagging non-specificity of detail: the students, their school, their rescuers, the doctors who treated them, and the medical facility where they were taken are all unnamed.

"Although the incident in Pennsylvania was reported as a breaking news story, it had allegedly occurred 20 months earlier (in April 1966). Dr. Yoder, blind from childhood due to an accident, had attended a lecture on the ""dangers of LSD"" in the autumn of 1967, and shortly afterwards he mentioned the story of the blinded students to Joseph Hunt, the commissioner of the Rehabilitation Service Administration, an office of the federal cabinet's Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Hunt asked Yoder for a written account of the incident, and Yoder complied by submitting actual case studies of six blind students (with the students' names covered over), all of whom were reportedly receiving state aid. This ""report"" was leaked to an Associated Press reporter who released it to the media on 13 January 1968, and outraged government officials took quick action. The next day the Federal Drug Administration announced it would conduct an investigation and prosecute the persons who had supplied LSD to the blinded students. On January 16, Pennsylvania state senator Benjamin R. Donolow and the press secretary for vacationing Pennsylvania governor Raymond P. Shafer both stated at news conferences that the story was true, as did Governor Shafer himself on January 17.",10,LSD Users Stare at Sun,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/blinded-by-the-light/,false,College students tripping on LSD stared at the sun until they went blind?,David Mikkelson,1998-11-03,Several students tripping on LSD stared at the sun until blinded.
"Some sensible skeptics managed to make themselves heard, however. Ophthamologists expressed their doubts that even LSD could override self-preservation instincts long enough to keep a person's eyes focused on the sun until retinal tissues burned, or that such an occurrence could have remained unreported twenty months later. And when investigators began to check on the case reports offered by Dr. Yoder, they found several damning inconsistencies: one of the ""victims"" had been receiving state aid since before April 1966, and another hadn't even been a student at the time of the alleged blindings. Yoder admitted on January 18 that he had made the whole thing up because of his ""concern over illegal LSD use by children."" The ""distraught and upset"" Commissioner Yoder was immediately suspended from his post as he checked himself into the Philadelphia Psychiatric Center, where he spent four weeks before being permanently removed from his position with the Welfare Department. (Although Dr. Norman Yoder is the name now mentioned whenever this story is discussed, the creation of this legend should be credited to the anonymous hoaxster[s] who had planted the ""blinded students"" articles in California newspapers eight months earlier.)",11,LSD Users Stare at Sun,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/blinded-by-the-light/,false,College students tripping on LSD stared at the sun until they went blind?,David Mikkelson,1998-11-03,Several students tripping on LSD stared at the sun until blinded.
"As usual, the unraveling of the legend received far less attention from the press than its sensational outbreak had produced, and it remained a widely believed drug horror story throughout the next decade. (Newsweek reluctantly printed a tiny retraction in response to a reader who wrote them that ""the entire affair was the ill-conceived hoax of individuals who possibly share your zealotry for evoking before the public's terror-charged eyes the many perils presumably awaiting the hallucinogenic traveler."")

"No instances of blindness have been shown to result from LSD use, but, of course, there are millions of blind people and hundreds of known causes of blindness which the public and press have shown much less concern about than the propaganda associating LSD with this severe disability. The propensity of the mass media uncritically to accept lurid and sensationalistic stories emanating from generally untrustworthy and uninformed government sources is probably far more dangerous to our social fabric than LSD.

"[Blundell & Hall, 1988] Of all things jinxed, few can have bestowed more misery than a motor car owned by the Hapsburg dynasty of imperial Austria. The open-topped limousine was given to the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the troubled throne. He rode in it in July 1914 on a state visit to Sarajevo. Sarajevo then was in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a state recently annexed by the imperial court of Vienna. In the car with the Archduke on this ill-fated day were his wife, General Potiorek of the Austrian army and three other dignitaries, plus a driver. A fervent young nationalist called Gavrilo Princip stepped in front of the vehicle on its official tour of the city and shot the Archduke and his wife, the Archduchess Sophie. More catastrophic still, this event was to trigger the First World War. General Potiorek became the next owner of the car. Several weeks into the war his armies suffered a rout at the hands of the ill-organised army of Serbia. The General was summoned back to Vienna by the Emperor Franz Josef I. And there in Vienna, his reputation ruined, his sanity destroyed, he died. [Another version adds the detail of Potiorek becoming an impoverished lunatic who eventually died in the almshouse.] A captain of Potiorek's staff took charge of the jinxed vehicle; nine days later in a terrible accident he killed two peasants on the road before swerving into a tree and killing himself. After the war, the governor of newly independent Yugoslavia took charge of the car. He endured a succession of terrible accidents, one of which cost him his left arm.

"Once inside she leaned against the door for a moment, relieved to be in the safety of her home. She glanced out the window to see if anyone was there. The sidewalk was empty. After tossing her books on the sofa she decided to grab a snack and get on line. There she could talk to strangers without being afraid. After all, no one knew who she really was and couldn't hurt her. She logged on under her screen name ""ByAngel213"". Checking her Buddy List she saw GoTo123 was on.

GoTo123 decided it was time to teach Angel a lesson. One she would never forget. He went to the member menu and began to search for her profile. When it came up he highlighted it and printed it out.

"Her name: Shannon. Birthday: Jan. 3, 1985. Age:13. State where she lived: North Carolina. Hobbies: softball, chorus, skating and going to the mall. Besides this information he knew she lived in Canton. She had just told him. He knew she stayed by herself until 6:30 every afternoon until her parents came home from work. He knew she played softball on Thursday afternoons on the school team and the team was named the Canton Cats. Her favorite number 7 was printed on her jersey. He knew she was in the seventh grade at the Canton Junior High School. She had told him all this in the conversations they had on line.

Shannon didn't tell her parents about the incident on the way home from the ball park that day. She didn't want them to make a scene and stop her from walking home from the softball games. Parents were always overreacting and hers were the worst. It made her wish she was not an only child. Maybe if she had brothers and sisters her parents wouldn't be so overprotective.,4,Shannon's Friend,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/shannons-friend/,false,Policeman cyberstalks a young girl to show her how information could be used to find someone?,Barbara Mikkelson,1998-09-21,A policeman stalks a young girl on the Internet to show her how easily even the most innocuous information can be used to find someone in real life.
By Thursday Shannon had forgotten about the footsteps following her. Her game was in full swing when suddenly she felt someone staring at her. It was then that the memory came back. She glanced up from her second base position to see a man watching her closely. He was leaning against the fence behind first base and he smiled when she looked at him.

After the game he sat on a bleacher while she talked to the coach. She noticed his smile once again as she walked past him. He nodded and she smiled back. He noticed her name on back of the shirt. He knew he had found her. Quietly he walked a safe distance behind her.

It was only a few blocks to Shannon's home and once he saw where she lived he quickly returned to the park to get his car. Now he had to wait. He decided to get a bite to eat until the time came to go to Shannon's house.

But while others do it to find kids and hurt them, I belong to a group of parents who do it to protect kids from predators. I came here to find you to teach you how dangerous it is to give out too much information to people online. You told me enough about yourself to make it easy for me to find you.

"When the princess Maria del Pozzo della Cisterna wed the duke of D'Aosta, son of the King of Italy, on 30 May 1867, the festivities were marred by such a tragic tangle of events that the royal family suppressed the truth lest the very news bring misfortune to the couple's life.",1,Death and the Wedding Party,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-and-the-wedding-party/,legend,The 1867 wedding of a princess and a duke was reportedly marred by tragedy on an unprecedented scale.,Barbara Mikkelson,1998-08-09,The 1867 wedding of a princess and a duke was marred by tragedy on an unprecedented scale.
"The ominous events began before the wedding when the bride's wardrobe mistress hanged herself, prompting the superstitious princess to order a new gown. The ceremony itself was delayed twice. First, the mounted officer appointed to lead the wedding procession from the palace to the church suffered sunstroke and collapsed. Then the palace gates failed to open for the matrimonial procession.

Fate tendered a reprieve during the ceremony but minutes later the best man — probably ineptly handling his ceremonial weapon — shot himself in the head. Eventually the bride and groom were escorted by a procession of carriages to the railway station where the royal newlyweds were to board a train for their honeymoon. More trouble dogged their footsteps. The officer who had drawn up the marriage contract suffered a stroke and the anxious stationmaster fell under the wheels of the approaching bridal locomotive.,3,Death and the Wedding Party,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-and-the-wedding-party/,legend,The 1867 wedding of a princess and a duke was reportedly marred by tragedy on an unprecedented scale.,Barbara Mikkelson,1998-08-09,The 1867 wedding of a princess and a duke was marred by tragedy on an unprecedented scale.

"AIDS Mary has been scaring the bejeebers out of us at least since the early 1980s. The pin prick legend, however, isn't all that new either, with the HIV version of it having its roots in an 1989 incident in New York City. The legend in its current incarnation (teenage girls in darkened theaters jabbed with needles) dates back to a much older non-HIV story, one rampant in the New Orleans area in the 1930s. Toothsome young girls were told to beware of Needle Men. Young ladies were strictly instructed to sit at the end of the aisle in moviehouses, not in the middle, lest they attract the attention of white slavers working in pairs who would sit down beside the girl, one on each side, inject her with morphine, and carry her out of the theatre and into a life of shame.",17,HIV-Infected Needle Attacks,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hiv-infected-needle-attacks/,false,Decades-old rumor holds that madmen are jabbing unsuspecting moviegoers with HIV-infected needles.,Snopes Staff,1998-03-01,Madmen are injecting HIV-infected blood into unsuspecting moviegoers and random young people dancing in bars or at raves.

"Though ""Needle Man"" scares rippled through New Orleans at various times in the 1920s and 1930s, each time sending women into hysterics, there was never any credible reason to believe such men existed.

"A slightly different yet inexplicably more frightening version of the pin prick legend began circulating in the early spring of 1998.

"Do you any of you guys like to go clubbing? Well you might want to think twice after this message. Just in case you don't already know, there is a certain group of people with stickers that say ""Welcome to our world."" Once this sticker is stuck on you, you contract the AIDS virus because it is filled with tiny needles carrying the infected blood. This has been happening at many dance clubs (even DV8 and Beatbox) and raves. Being cautious is not enough because the person just chooses anyone, and I mean anyone, as his/her victim. So you could just be dancing the night away and not even realize the sticker had been stuck on you. It sounds too demented to be true, but it's the truth.

All syringes so employed have tested out as perfectly clean.

"This attack plus a spate of supposedly HIV-loaded needle robberies (the robberies at needlepoint were real, but the HIV part was never proved), prompted the Australian government to introduce legislation covering such offenses. Since the victim didn't die within a year and a day of the pricking, the attacker couldn't be charged with murder under the old laws. That changed in 1990.

"British police would like to have something a lot closer to what the Australian legal system provides for. In 1994 they unsuccessfully called for a crackdown on HIV-loaded needle threats, claiming the harm done to victims necessitated both harsher penalties than currently legally available and voicing the need to be able to charge someone in possession of a syringe with carrying an offensive weapon. At present, the psychological damage caused by the threat to inject someone with an HIV-infected syringe is classed in Britain as actual bodily harm, and an attacker can be charged with grievous bodily harm if an injury is sustained.

"Fire Authorities in California found a corpse in a burnt out section of forest whilst assessing the damage done by a forest fire. The deceased male was dressed in a full wetsuit, complete with a dive tank, flippers and face mask. A post mortem examination revealed that the person died not from burns but from massive internal injuries. Dental records provided a positive identification. Investigators then set about determining how a fully clad diver ended up in the middle of a forest fire. It was revealed that, on the day of the fire, the person went for a diving trip off the coast — some 20 kilometers away from the forest. The firefighters, seeking to control the fire as quickly as possible, called in a fleet of helicopters with very large buckets. The buckets were dropped into the ocean for rapid filling, then flown to the forest fire and emptied. You guessed it. One minute our diver was making like Flipper in the Pacific, the next he was doing a breaststroke in a fire bucket 300m in the air.

Such courses have typically included a mixture of instruction in traffic laws and regulations, training with driving simulators, and the viewing of ""safety"" films such as Mechanized Death, Wheels of Tragedy, and Red Asphalt, the last of them described by the Los Angeles Times as follows:",2,Was a Volkswagen Beetle and Its Passengers Crushed Between Two Trucks?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/crushin-roulette/,legend,"Beep, beep.

"""Red Asphalt"" — the title says it all — is the flip side of California's carefree car culture.

"The ""crushed Beetle"" example quoted above is akin to an oral Red Asphalt tableau, with true horror apparent only in retrospect: Two 18-wheelers that collided head-on have become fused together as a result and are removed from the accident scene in that state; not until they are pulled apart at a wreckage yard days (or weeks) later does someone discover that a Volkswagen Beetle — with its dead driver and occupants still inside — had been crushed between them. In one sense, this legend might be read as merely a general warning on the potential dangers associated with driving, with the inclusion of the largest and smallest vehicles then commonly found on roadways (i.e., tractor-trailers and a VW Beetle) used to heighten the horrific effect and make the plot device of delayed discovery plausible. On the other hand, this legend might be interpreted as a commentary on our industrial society: You, dear individual commuter, in your small, cheap vehicle, are of little importance compared to the big rigs that transport the raw materials and finished goods which keep our economy running; you're just collateral damage that we have to clean up if and when we get around to finding you.",4,Was a Volkswagen Beetle and Its Passengers Crushed Between Two Trucks?,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/crushin-roulette/,legend,"Beep, beep.
