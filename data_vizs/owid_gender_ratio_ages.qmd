The data for this graphic is sourced from Our World in Data, based on United Nations World Population Prospects (2022). It showcases the sex ratios at different ages—from birth to 80 years—across three countries with a historical preference for male children: **China, India, and Vietnam**, spanning seven decades from the 1950s to the 2010s. The graphic reveals distinct patterns in how male preference impacts sex ratios over time. In China, the one-child policy and prenatal diagnostics significantly skewed birth ratios towards males, but a balance is seen in older age groups. India exhibits a consistent male dominance across all ages, reflecting poorer female healthcare and higher mortality. Vietnam, while showing increased male births in recent decades, continues to have females outliving males significantly, indicating better health outcomes for women as they age.

![This graphic illustrates the sex ratios at different ages—ranging from birth to 80 years—across three countries: China, India, and Vietnam. Each row represents a country, while each column depicts a decade from the 1950s to the 2010s. The x-axis shows the sex ratio (number of females per 100 males), and the y-axis represents the age groups.](a4_owid_gender_ratio_ages.png){width="1200"}

china_text <- "During the 1940s, an excess number of boys were born, a bulge towards males, that continued into the 1990s. After 2000, another surge in the birth of boys is evident, perhaps linked to the one-child policy and the use of pre-natal diagnostic techniques. Despite these imbalances at birth, the sex ratio evens out in older age groups, with more females surviving beyond the age of 50, in line with world average."

india_text <- "A persistent male preference, with more males than females across all age groups, contrary to global trends. While the sex ratio at birth aligns closely with the natural ratio, the disparity grows as age increases. This indicates poorer healthcare and higher mortality rates for females. Unlike other countries, India's females do not outlive males significantly."

vietnam_text <- "A notable pattern of longevity for females, with women significantly outliving men, especially in the older age groups. While this is in line with global trends, but even more pronounced in Vietnam. However, in the past two decades (2000-2020), there has been a marked increase in the number of male births, likely due to the use of pre-natal sex selection techniques."
