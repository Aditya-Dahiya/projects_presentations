Loading the data, E.D.A., and cleaning the names

```{r}

# Set the working directory (I didnt want to host raw data on GitHub)
list.files("loop_habits")

# Define the directory containing the CSV files
directory <- "loop_habits"

# List all CSV files in the directory
csv_files <- list.files(
  path = directory, 
  pattern = "\\.csv$", 
  full.names = TRUE
  )

# Extract base names (without file extension) to use as object names
file_names <- tools::file_path_sans_ext(basename(csv_files)) |>
  tolower()

# Read each CSV file and assign it to an object with the corresponding name
purrr::walk2(
  csv_files, 
  file_names, 
  ~ assign(.y, read_csv(.x), 
           envir = .GlobalEnv)
  )

# Apply janitor::clean_names() to all created objects
purrr::walk(
  file_names, ~
    {
      cleaned_data <- get(.x) |>  clean_names() 
      # Retrieve object, clean names
      
      assign(.x, cleaned_data, envir = .GlobalEnv) 
      # Reassign cleaned data back to the same object
    }

# Remove the temporary files
rm(csv_files, directory, file_names)
```

Cleaning up the data and keeping only the relevant variables
