## Migration: Internal and Inter-Continental Flows (2020)

Created using {`circlize`} package [@circlize] and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) Image Processing software.

The data for this circular Chord Diagram diagram, depicting migration flows in 2020, is sourced from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) and processed by Our World in Data. It includes comprehensive international migrant statistics, standardized and refined through several processing steps to ensure accuracy and clarity. The graphic highlights key findings, showing the near universal migration to High_income countries, especially from Middle-Income countries. For more details, visit the [UN DESA International Migrant Stock](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/content/international-migrant-stock) page.

![This graphic visualizes global migration flows for the year 2020 using data sourced from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) and processed by Our World in Data. It highlights migration patterns in countries of different income groups through a Circular Chord Diagram, with arrows representing the flow of migration.](owid_income_circlize_migrants.png)
