### Where are the biggest gains in life expectancy: Early Life or Old Age?

The graph is based on life expectancy data sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) (using `owidR` [package](https://github.com/piersyork/owidR)) and [Gapminder.org](https://www.gapminder.org/), comparing the percentage rise in life expectancy at birth with the percentage rise in life expectancy beyond age 65 across six decades (1960s-2010s) for various countries. Each dot represents a country and is colored by its GDP per capita, with red indicating low GDP per capita (poor countries) and green indicating high GDP per capita (rich countries). The 45-degree line represents equal percentage rises for both indicators.

**Main Findings:**

1.  The overall rate of rise in life expectancy was highest in the 1960s and 1970s, reflecting the rapid spread of modern medicine in the post-World War II era, and has been slowing down globally.

2.  Most of the gains in the initial decades were in poorer countries due to widespread vaccinations and control of childhood infectious diseases, indicated by most dots being below the 45-degree line in the 1960s and 1970s.

3.  Richer countries (green dots) have focused more on elderly care, resulting in a higher rise in life expectancy beyond 65 years compared to poorer countries (red dots).

4.  Over recent decades, as countries grow richer, more are improving life expectancy beyond 65 years through enhanced elderly care, shown by more dots appearing above the 45-degree line.
